# `crons/`

Markdown-frontmatter cron definitions consumed by
`.oh/scripts/cron-runtime.ts`. Each `<id>.md` file declares one scheduled
job; the runtime scans this directory at boot, schedules every enabled
job via [Croner](https://github.com/Hexagon/croner), and re-fires the
file's body as the next prompt to the active agent.

`CLAUDE.md` is a provider-compatibility symlink to this file. Edit `AGENTS.md`.

These files are **agent instructions, not documentation**. A cron body is a
prompt an agent executes unattended, on a schedule, with no operator in the
loop — which is why this directory carries an `AGENTS.md` rather than a
`README.md`. Read it before writing or editing a cron: the frontmatter
contract, the failure tokens the runtime logs, and the reload rules below
are what stand between a bad edit and a job that silently stops firing.

A file here that is not a valid cron is skipped by predicate, not by name:
`loadCrons` requires a line-1 `---` frontmatter block whose `id` matches the
filename basename and whose `schedule` parses. This file has no frontmatter,
so it never enters the scheduled set — the same reason it is safe to drop a
non-cron doc in here.

See `.oh/scripts/cron-runtime.ts` for the runtime implementation
(frontmatter parsing, scheduling, overlap/catchup semantics).

## Editing a cron — what takes effect when

| Change | Takes effect |
| --- | --- |
| Body (the agent prompt) | Next fire, automatically — the runtime re-reads the file. Logs `BODY_RELOADED`. |
| Frontmatter (`schedule`, `enabled`, `timezone`, `overlap`, `agent`, `tmux`, `preflight`) | Only after a `SIGHUP` reschedule or a runtime restart. Until then the **old** schedule is live. |
| Adding or removing a `<id>.md` file | Only after a `SIGHUP` reschedule or a runtime restart. |
| `.oh/scripts/cron-runtime.ts` itself | Only after a full runtime restart. |

The frontmatter row is the one that bites: an edited `schedule:` looks applied
in git and is not applied in the runtime. See
[Reload schedules](#reload-schedules-sighup).

## File shape

```markdown
---
id: <unique-id>          # runtime-enforced: must match filename, kebab-case
schedule: "0 23 * * 0"   # 5-field cron expression
timezone: America/Denver
enabled: true
overlap: false           # skip new fire if previous still running
catchup: false           # don't replay missed fires after downtime
tmux: false              # optional — run each fire in its own detached tmux session
agent: pi                # optional — override CRON_AGENT_BIN for this job only

# Title

Body becomes the agent prompt at fire time.
```

## Conventions

- Filename = `<id>.md`, kebab-case.
- systemd supervises the runtime as `openharness-cron.service`; only detached
  job fires get tmux sessions, named `cron-<id>-<MMDD>-<HHMM>` under the
  `cron-` category prefix (see
  `.oh/skills/t3/references/sandbox-processes.md`).
- Disable a job by setting `enabled: false` — do not delete the file
  (preserves history).
- Runtime artefacts in this directory (`.cron.log`, `.pid`) are
  gitignored; markdown definitions are tracked.

## Status tokens

The runtime appends one tab-separated line per event to the gitignored
`crons/.cron.log`, shaped `<iso-timestamp>\t<id>\t<status>\t<msg>`. The
status column is one of:

| Token | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `BOOT` | Runtime started and scheduled its crons (`id` is `system`; `msg` is the cron count). |
| `RELOAD` | A `SIGHUP` reschedule re-read `crons/` and re-armed every schedule without restarting the runtime (`id` is `system`; `msg` is the cron count, e.g. `4 scheduled, 0 skipped`). See [Hot-reload](#hot-reload). |
| `ID_INVALID` | A cron was skipped because its resolved `id` or filename basename is not lowercase kebab-case (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`). |
| `ID_MISMATCH` | A cron was skipped because its explicit frontmatter `id` does not match the filename basename. |
| `SCHED_INVALID` | A cron was skipped because its `schedule:` is not a valid cron expression (`msg` contains the offending schedule string). |
| `AGENT_INVALID` | A cron was skipped because its `agent:` override or effective `CRON_AGENT_BIN` is not a safe executable token/path. |
| `SPAWNED` | A `tmux: true` fire launched its detached session (`msg` is the session name). |
| `FIRE` | A scheduled job fired and began running its body. |
| `AGENT_START` | The shell wrapper started an agent for the task (`msg` is `agent=<name>`). A Claude→Codex fallback emits a second `AGENT_START` for Codex. |
| `AGENT_FALLBACK` | Default Claude execution hit a usage/session-limit pattern and retried through Codex (`msg` is `from=claude to=codex`). |
| `AGENT_DONE` | The shell wrapper finished an agent run (`msg` is `agent=<name> exit=<code>`), making the completing agent evident even after fallback. |
| `OK` | The fired child process exited cleanly (exit code 0). |
| `EXIT_n` | The fired child process exited non-zero with code `n`. When the job's log file is populated, a bounded tail of the job's trailing output is appended as the `msg` (4th column) — the optional field already used by `ERR_JOB`/`ERR`/`BODY_RELOADED` — so the failure is diagnosable from `.cron.log` alone (see example below). |
| `ERR` | The child process failed to spawn (process-level error, not a job throw). |
| `ERR_JOB` | A synchronous cron job-callback threw; recorded instead of being swallowed. Format: `<id>\tERR_JOB\t<error-string>`. |
| `SKIPPED_OVERLAP` | A fire was skipped because the previous run was still in flight (`overlap: false`). |

An enriched `EXIT_n` line (tab-separated, tail whitespace-collapsed and
bounded to 200 chars):

```text
2026-06-12T23:30:00.000Z\theartbeat\tEXIT_1\tError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432 … (bounded tail of the job's log)
```

A cron whose resolved `id` or filename basename is unsafe, whose explicit
`id` does not match the filename basename, whose `agent:` override is unsafe,
or whose `schedule:` string is not a valid cron expression is skipped at load
time — it logs `ID_INVALID`, `ID_MISMATCH`, `AGENT_INVALID`, or
`SCHED_INVALID` and never enters the scheduled set. A single malformed cron
definition cannot crash the runtime and the other crons keep running. If the
global `CRON_AGENT_BIN` is unsafe, each affected fire logs `AGENT_INVALID` and
returns before generating a shell wrapper or spawning an agent.

`BODY_RELOADED` and `BODY_RELOAD_ERR` are documented under
[Hot-reload](#hot-reload).

## Scheduled jobs

| File | Schedule | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `heartbeat.md` | `0 * * * *` (hourly) — currently `enabled: false` | Hourly pulse — review memory, surface anything urgent |
| `cleanup-tasks.md` | `0 23 * * 0` (Sun 23:00 MT) | Weekly `/spec execute` task sweep — archive completed tasks |
| `eval-weekly.md` | `0 6 * * 0` (Sun 06:00 MT) | Weekly eval suite — run probes, log any regressions to memory |
| `prompt-miner.md` | `0 5 * * *` (daily 05:00 MT) | Daily prompt-miner — mine 24h of session traces for prompt-quality markers; ship a top finding to the origin fork via `/spec` (opt-in `enabled: false`, cap-gated by `preflight: .oh/skills/prompt-miner/prompt-miner-caps.sh`) |

## Runtime supervision

systemd is PID 1 in the sandbox and runs `.oh/scripts/cron-runtime.ts` directly as `openharness-cron.service` (user `sandbox`, working directory `/home/sandbox/harness`). It starts after `openharness-bootstrap.service`, restarts on failure, and its `ExecReload` sends `SIGHUP`. Inspect it with `systemctl status openharness-cron.service` and read its output with `journalctl -u openharness-cron.service`.

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Liveness | `systemctl is-active openharness-cron.service` |
| Reschedule (SIGHUP) | `systemctl reload openharness-cron.service` |
| Restart | `systemctl restart openharness-cron.service` |
| Logs | `journalctl -u openharness-cron.service` |

There is no tmux supervisor and no tmux wrapper around the scheduler. tmux remains the convention for detached job fires.

## tmux sessions

A job with `tmux: true` in its frontmatter runs each fire in its own detached tmux session instead of an in-process child, so the user can attach to a run, read its scrollback, and reattach later.

- **Session name**: `cron-<id>-<MMDD>-<HHMM>` (e.g. `cron-heartbeat-0610-1805`), derived from the fire time. The runtime logs `SPAWNED <session>` to `.cron.log`.
- **Agent selection**: by default jobs use `CRON_AGENT_BIN` (compose default: `claude`). A cron can set `agent: <binary>` in frontmatter to override that for one job (for example `agent: pi`, so the run and its kept session are attachable Pi sessions without forcing heartbeat/cleanup/eval onto Pi). Agent binaries must be non-empty executable tokens or paths made from `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, `.`, `/`, and `-`; values with whitespace, shell metacharacters, `..`, or leading `-` are rejected with `AGENT_INVALID` before shell wrapper generation.
- **Agent attribution**: the shell wrapper logs `AGENT_START agent=<name>` and `AGENT_DONE agent=<name> exit=<code>` from inside the run. If default Claude falls back to Codex, `.cron.log` shows `AGENT_START agent=claude`, `AGENT_FALLBACK from=claude to=codex`, `AGENT_START agent=codex`, then `AGENT_DONE agent=codex exit=<code>`.
- **Env exported into the agent**: `CRON_TMUX_SESSION=<session>`, `CRON_KEEP_MARKER=/tmp/<session>.keep`, and `CRON_OVERLAP_PIDFILE=/tmp/cron-<id>.pid`.
- **Keep-marker contract**: if the agent `touch`es `$CRON_KEEP_MARKER` before exiting, the session persists by resuming the run's own conversation as a live, attachable agent (`claude --continue` for a Claude run, `pi --continue` for an `agent: pi` run, or `codex` after a Claude→Codex fallback), falling back to a shell if that exits; otherwise it auto-closes when the agent finishes. Claude/Codex tmux runs are headless (`claude -p`, or `codex exec --sandbox danger-full-access` after a Claude usage/session-limit fallback). Pi tmux runs intentionally use the positional TUI shape (`pi "$(cat prompt)"`), matching `tmux new -s <name> pi "<prompt>"`, so attaching mid-run shows the live Pi pane instead of a blank piped/headless screen. By convention a job keeps its session only when the run produced something worth revisiting (e.g. a PR was opened).
- **Overlap guard**: a per-id pidfile `/tmp/cron-<id>.pid` blocks a new fire while a previous one is still running when `overlap: false`; the skipped fire logs `SKIPPED_OVERLAP`. Kept interactive sessions that reach a terminal state can remove `$CRON_OVERLAP_PIDFILE` themselves before staying alive for manual review, so an intentionally retained pane does not suppress future fires.

Jobs with `tmux` absent or `false` keep the default in-process spawn.

## Hot-reload

A cron definition's **body** (the agent prompt) hot-reloads at fire time: the runtime re-reads the file just before each fire, so edits take effect at the next scheduled fire without a restart. On a read/parse error, the runtime falls back to the cached boot-time body and logs `BODY_RELOAD_ERR`. When a fire's body differs from the boot-time cached version, a `BODY_RELOADED` line appears in `crons/.cron.log` — this signal recurs on every fire after an edit until the runtime is restarted (which re-baselines). Schedule/frontmatter changes (`schedule`, `enabled`, `timezone`, `overlap`) and added/removed `crons/*.md` files now take effect via a `SIGHUP` reschedule (see [Reload schedules](#reload-schedules-sighup) below) — there is still no auto-watcher, so the reload is operator-triggered. A full runtime restart is only needed for `.oh/scripts/cron-runtime.ts` *code* changes. Rollback: remove the `reloadBody` call and restore the two `entry.body` usages in `.oh/scripts/cron-runtime.ts`.

## Reload schedules (SIGHUP)

The runtime installs a `SIGHUP` handler: on signal it stops the live croner jobs, re-reads every `crons/*.md`, and re-arms the schedules — so schedule/frontmatter edits and added/removed cron files apply without restarting the service. Each successful reload appends a `RELOAD` line (`id` `system`, `msg` the cron count) to `crons/.cron.log`. A malformed `schedule:` present during a reload is dropped (`SCHED_INVALID`) exactly as at boot; the rest stay scheduled and the runtime does not exit. In-flight fires are not interrupted — `overlap: false` remains the only protection against a reschedule racing a still-running fire.

The runtime runs inside the container, so reload from the host via `docker exec`:

```bash
# Health check first — confirm the PID file points at a live runtime.
docker exec -u sandbox openharness sh -c 'kill -0 "$(cat crons/.pid)" 2>/dev/null && echo alive || echo "not running"'

# Reload schedules.
docker exec openharness systemctl reload openharness-cron.service
```

The bare `kill -HUP "$(cat crons/.pid)"` form works only from *inside* the container — the host is a different PID namespace, so the PID in `crons/.pid` (set by `PID_FILE`) does not resolve there. **Escape hatch:** if a reload arms zero crons (e.g. files removed by accident), restart the runtime to restore the last good state — `systemctl restart openharness-cron.service`; systemd relaunches `node --experimental-strip-types .oh/scripts/cron-runtime.ts` from `.devcontainer/openharness-cron.service`.

## Layout

The runtime always reads `crons/` at the repository root, and `/worktrees`
scratch roots always live under `.worktrees/`. These locations are a convention,
not a setting; `.oh/scripts/oh-path crons` and `.oh/scripts/oh-path worktrees`
resolve them.
