# Weekly Task Cleanup

Sweep `.agro/tasks/` once per week and archive anything that has finished.
Per SPEC v0.7 §"Weekly cleanup cron": completed tasks move into the
dated archive under `.agro/tasks/`; incomplete tasks are left alone with a
note. The same weekly pass also grooms stale `.worktrees/` branch
checkouts, but it never touches the durable `.worktrees/agent/`
namespace, and never looks at the `projects/` clone root at all. `crons/.cron.log` carries liveness
only — never a `.agro/tasks/` subfolder.

## Tasks

1. Compute `TODAY=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)`. The dated destination
   `.agro/tasks/archive/$TODAY/` is created inside the worktree (step 4); all
   archive moves now run there, not in the shared checkout.
2. **Pre-flight (scoped to `.agro/tasks/`):** check only the surface this job
   mutates — run `git status --porcelain -- .agro/tasks/ ':!.agro/tasks/archive/'`.
   Only a mid-write task under `.agro/tasks/` (the `.agro/tasks/archive/`
   destination is excluded so an in-progress archive write never
   self-flags the sweep) blocks the run; foreign WIP elsewhere in the
   shared checkout — an in-flight feature branch, a concurrent session's
   edits — is untouched and does NOT abort the sweep, mirroring the
   cron system's `BLOCKED-OWNED-WIP` owned-surface convention. If that
   scoped status is non-empty, abort: append a note to
   the reply, emit the distinct liveness token to
   `crons/.cron.log`
   (`printf '[%s] cleanup-tasks: %s\n' "$(date -Iseconds)" "BLOCKED-TASKS-WIP" | .agro/scripts/locked-append.sh crons/.cron.log`),
   and stop here — do NOT fall through to step 7's `OK` line. This
   `BLOCKED-TASKS-WIP` token is intentionally distinct from the
   `OK (archived N, skipped M)` success token and the `HEARTBEAT_OK`
   nothing-to-do reply. Do not contaminate the archive branch with
   unrelated changes.
3. Resolve `$BASE` = default target branch per `/git` (`.agro/skills/git/SKILL.md`)
   (`development` → `main` → `master`, whichever exists). Fetch it
   (`git fetch origin "$BASE"`), then provision a dedicated, crash-safe
   worktree for the archive work — never branch or commit against the
   shared checkout (its dirty state must neither block a switch nor leak
   into the archive commit):
   - **Prune stale first** so a same-day re-run is idempotent (tear down
     and recreate — never reuse a possibly-dirty worktree left by a prior
     failed run):
     ```bash
     bash .agro/scripts/git-maintenance.sh worktree-remove .worktrees/archive/$TODAY 2>/dev/null || true
     bash .agro/scripts/git-maintenance.sh branch-delete "archive/$TODAY" 2>/dev/null || true   # drop a stale branch from a partial run
     git worktree prune
     ```
   - **Create** the worktree off `origin/$BASE` (paths resolve from the
     repo root, not the cron's ambient cwd):
     ```bash
     git worktree add .worktrees/archive/$TODAY -b archive/$TODAY origin/$BASE
     ```
   - **Arm crash-safe teardown** so a failed push/PR step (or any error
     exit) never strands the worktree for next week's run to collide with:
     ```bash
     trap 'bash .agro/scripts/git-maintenance.sh worktree-remove .worktrees/archive/$TODAY 2>/dev/null || true; git worktree prune' EXIT
     ```
   Every `git` command for the archive from here on runs inside the
   worktree via `git -C .worktrees/archive/$TODAY <cmd>`.
4. Inside the worktree, create the dated destination
   (`mkdir -p .worktrees/archive/$TODAY/.agro/tasks/archive/$TODAY`), then scan
   the worktree's `origin/$BASE` checkout — committed state only, so
   uncommitted task dirs in the shared checkout are never archived. For
   each `.worktrees/archive/$TODAY/.agro/tasks/<taskdesc>/` (skipping
   `.agro/tasks/archive/`):
   - If every user story in `.agro/tasks/<taskdesc>/prd.json` passes —
     `jq -e 'all(.userStories[]; .passes == true)' .agro/tasks/<taskdesc>/prd.json`
     exits 0 — the task is complete:
     - Move the folder inside the worktree:
       `git -C .worktrees/archive/$TODAY mv .agro/tasks/<taskdesc> .agro/tasks/archive/$TODAY/<taskdesc>`
       (falls back to `mv` + `git -C .worktrees/archive/$TODAY add` if
       `git mv` rejects an untracked path).
   - Otherwise, leave the folder in place and append a one-line note to
     the reply recording that `<taskdesc>` is still active, how many user
     stories remain unpassed
     (`jq '[.userStories[] | select(.passes != true)] | length' .agro/tasks/<taskdesc>/prd.json`),
     and the last `progress.txt` modification time.
   - Task state is read from the task folder alone and is **never** tied to a
     tied to a terminal session, tab, or pane: the sweep does not look for,
     attach to, or kill any implementation-agent process.
   - A task folder with **no readable `prd.json`** — the file is missing,
     unparseable, or carries no `userStories` array, so the `jq` test above
     fails rather than exits 0 — is **not** complete: leave the folder in
     place and note it in the reply as `unreadable-prd`, counted with the
     still-active skips.
5. **Groom stale `.worktrees/` branch checkouts** from the shared repo
   root after the task scan. Initialize `W=0` plus a `GROOMED_WORKTREES`
   list. This pass is intentionally limited to harness branch worktrees
   and cron/archive leftovers: it must skip any path under
   `.worktrees/agent/` without inspecting or mutating that namespace, and
   must never descend into the `projects/` clone root, which is outside the
   worktree root entirely. Also skip the current archive worktree
   `.worktrees/archive/$TODAY` until step 8 tears it down.
   - Build the registered-worktree candidate set from
     `git worktree list --porcelain`. For each worktree path under
     `$PWD/.worktrees/` that is NOT under `.worktrees/agent/`, NOT under
     `projects/`, and NOT `.worktrees/archive/$TODAY`:
     - Skip if any live tmux pane is cwd'd inside it:
       `tmux list-panes -a -F '#{pane_current_path}' | grep -F -- "$path"`.
     - Skip if its branch has an open PR:
       `gh pr list --head "$branch" --state open --json number --jq 'length'`.
     - Skip if the worktree's latest commit is newer than 30 days.
     - Before removal, run a preservation gate inside the candidate
       worktree. Skip and log the candidate if any of these checks fail:
       - unstaged edits: `git -C "$path" diff --quiet` is non-zero;
       - staged edits: `git -C "$path" diff --cached --quiet` is non-zero;
       - untracked files: `git -C "$path" ls-files --others --exclude-standard`
         returns any path;
       - missing branch/upstream metadata: `git -C "$path" rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
         or `git -C "$path" rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}` fails;
       - unpushed commits: `git -C "$path" log --oneline @{u}..HEAD`
         returns any commit.
     - Otherwise remove it with `bash .agro/scripts/git-maintenance.sh worktree-remove "$path"`,
       append the path to `GROOMED_WORKTREES`, and increment `W`.
   - Then prune corrupt/orphan folders that are not registered git
     worktrees: scan `.worktrees/` directories excluding `.worktrees/agent/`,
     `projects/`, and `.worktrees/archive/$TODAY`. For each older
     directory with no live tmux pane cwd'd inside it, remove it only when it
     is provably empty using `rmdir "$path"`; skip and log every non-empty or
     suspicious orphan directory for manual review instead of deleting it
     recursively.
   - Remove empty non-reserved namespace directories left behind by the
     sweep (`find .worktrees -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d ! -name agent -empty -delete`), then run `git worktree prune`.
   - Add a one-line note to the reply for each skipped
     registered worktree or preserved orphan, recording the reason (`open-pr`,
     `live-pane`, `too-new`, `dirty`, `staged`, `untracked`, `missing-upstream`,
     `unpushed`, `orphan-nonempty`, or `orphan-live-pane`) and its last commit
     time when available.
6. If anything was archived this run (`N > 0`) — every git step runs
   inside the worktree via `git -C .worktrees/archive/$TODAY`:
   - Stage the moves: `git -C .worktrees/archive/$TODAY add .agro/tasks/`.
   - Commit: `git -C .worktrees/archive/$TODAY commit -m "archive: weekly cleanup $TODAY (N tasks)"`.
   - Push: `git -C .worktrees/archive/$TODAY push -u origin "archive/$TODAY"`.
   - Open a PR (or update an existing one for the same branch) per
     `.agro/skills/git/SKILL.md` conventions:
     `gh pr create --base "$BASE" --head "archive/$TODAY" \
        --title "FROM archive/$TODAY TO $BASE" \
        --body "Weekly task sweep — archived N completed tasks, skipped M still-active, groomed W stale worktrees.\n\nArchived: <list>\nSkipped: <list>\nGroomed worktrees: <list>"`.
     If `gh pr create` reports the PR already exists, capture its URL
     via `gh pr view --json url -q .url` instead.
7. After the sweep, append a single summary line to
   the reply: `cleanup-tasks: archived N, skipped M, groomed W worktrees, pr <url-or-none>`.
8. **Mandatory closing steps (always run):**
   - **Tear down the worktree** — covers normal completion, the
     nothing-to-archive case (`N = 0`), and partial runs; complements the
     step-3 `trap`, which also fires on any error/abort exit:
     `bash .agro/scripts/git-maintenance.sh worktree-remove .worktrees/archive/$TODAY 2>/dev/null || true; git worktree prune`.
   - **Liveness line:** append one liveness line to `crons/.cron.log` through
     `.agro/scripts/locked-append.sh`:
     `printf '[%s] cleanup-tasks: %s\n' "$(date -Iseconds)" "OK (archived N, skipped M, groomed W worktrees)" | .agro/scripts/locked-append.sh crons/.cron.log`.
     Create the file if it does not exist.

## Reporting

- Nothing to archive, nothing skipped, and no stale worktrees groomed →
  reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` (no branch, no PR).
- Otherwise → list archived tasks, skipped tasks, and groomed worktrees
  with counts, plus the PR URL (if any tasks were archived) on a final
  line.
