# Contract probes that pin multi-word prose break on reflow, not on drift

## Relevant Source Files
- `.oh/evals/probes/wiki-kind-schema-contract.sh@bfe22487` — ten pinned literals over one reference document; the two longest were the two that failed.
- `.oh/skills/wiki/references/schema.md@c841e567` — the pinned document, hard-wrapped prose.

## Summary
A contract probe that asserts a reference document still says something usually does
it with a fixed-string grep. When the pinned string is a whole sentence and the
document is hard-wrapped, the assertion is bound to the line breaks rather than to
the claim, and any rewrap fails the probe without the contract having changed.

## Detail
**Symptom.** A probe reports REGRESSION naming a sentence that is plainly still
present in the document it guards. The failure is a line break inside the pinned
string: `grep -qF` matches within a single line, so a sentence the author wrote as
one clause but the file stores across two lines can never match. Two of the ten
`need` assertions in `.agro/evals/probes/wiki-kind-schema-contract.sh:22-31` failed on
their first run for exactly this reason, against unchanged contract text; the
remaining eight, which pin short fragments, table cells, and code tokens, matched
immediately.

**Root cause.** The probe's matcher operates on lines
(`.agro/evals/probes/wiki-kind-schema-contract.sh:18-20`) while the contract it means
to pin is a claim. Nothing in the assertion distinguishes the load-bearing words
from the incidental whitespace that a formatter, an editor's rewrap, or a later
sentence-length edit will move. The longer the pinned string, the higher the
probability it spans a wrap boundary, so the failure rate rises with the very
specificity that made the assertion feel rigorous.

**Workaround.** Pin the shortest fragment that is still unique and unambiguous, and
choose it so it cannot straddle a line break: a heading, a table cell, a code token,
or the distinctive four-to-six words of the claim. The surviving assertions in
`.agro/evals/probes/wiki-kind-schema-contract.sh:22-31` are all of that shape, and
several deliberately stop mid-sentence at the wrap boundary rather than reach past
it. Where a whole-sentence assertion is genuinely required, normalize before
matching — fold the document's whitespace to single spaces and match against the
normalized text — instead of pinning the stored bytes.

A second failure mode of the same matcher, found by issue #926: a **short** pin
can be too weak rather than too brittle. `grep -qF '## Knowledge Context'`
survived deleting the block it guards, because the section heading that *names*
the block contains the same substring. Both planning probes reported PASS against
a document with the contract removed. Where the pinned text is a whole line — a
heading, a template block, a table row — assert it with `grep -qxF` so a mention
cannot satisfy an assertion about the thing itself
(`.agro/evals/probes/spec-plan-knowledge-context.sh:29-32`). Fault injection is what
surfaced it; neither probe had ever been run against a broken input.

A third instance, from task `one-door` (#948): a documentation sweep that rewrote
onboarding sentences to put `oh tool install herdr` before `herdr` broke two
whole-sentence pins in `.agro/scripts/__tests__/herdr-default.test.ts:62-63`
("then run `herdr` first") and pushed `AGENTS.md` 13 bytes over the 9500-byte
always-on budget that `.agro/evals/probes/context-tier-size-budget.sh` enforces. The
contract the test protects — Herdr is the first interactive action — still held;
only the pinned bytes had moved. Workaround, appended 2026-09-02: when a wave
rewrites prose, run the suites that pin that prose in the same wave and repin to
the shortest fragment that carries the claim (here `run \`oh tool install herdr\`
and \`herdr\` first`), and treat any always-on byte budget as one of those pins;
the fix is mechanical, but a later wave that does not know the pins exist pays a
full gate cycle to find them.
