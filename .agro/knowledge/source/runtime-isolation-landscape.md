# Runtime Isolation Landscape (2026)

## Relevant Source Files
- `raw/2026-07-04-runtime-isolation-landscape.md` — WebFetch snapshot (isolation strategies) + the multi-source 2026 landscape corpus.
- `docs/rfcs/rfc-runtime-support.md` — the Open Harness runtime-support RFC whose fit matrix this entry backs.

## Summary
A reference map of the 2026 sandbox-isolation options for running agent-generated code, ranked by isolation depth and tagged to the harness's runtime axes (A1 substrate, A2 deploy, A3 fan-out). The load-bearing fact: **plain containers are Level-1 isolation** ("insufficient for anything an LLM generates"), which is exactly the harness's current substrate — one privileged container sharing the host kernel and Docker socket. Stronger tiers (gVisor → Kata/Firecracker) exist and are what an A1 upgrade would adopt.

## Detail
**Isolation ladder (deepest last).**
- **Plain containers (runc/namespaces)** — Level 1. Shared host kernel + cgroups; a kernel exploit in one container can compromise all. Fine for trusted code, not untrusted LLM output.
- **gVisor (`runsc`)** — Level 2. A user-space kernel intercepts/re-implements syscalls so the workload never touches the real kernel; imperfect syscall coverage causes some compatibility friction. Used by Google (Agent Sandbox on GKE) and **Modal**. Cheapest step up from plain containers — a drop-in OCI runtime.
- **Kata Containers** — Level 3. MicroVM-grade isolation (dedicated kernel via hardware virtualization) **while keeping full Docker/OCI image compatibility** — the lowest-friction path to microVM depth. Offered by Northflank and **Daytona**.
- **Firecracker microVMs** — Level 3, the "gold standard for untrusted code." Kernel-per-sandbox on KVM; boots in **~125ms with ~5MB overhead**. Powers AWS Lambda, **E2B**, and Vercel Sandbox.

**Managed sandbox-as-a-service (A1/A3).** **E2B** (Firecracker, ~150ms cold start), **Daytona** (sub-90ms; Docker default, optional Kata path), **Fly Machines** (Firecracker), **Modal** (Python-native, GPU A100/H100, gVisor). Cold-start caveat: at high concurrency (~400 parallel starts) CNI/virtual-switch setup dominates, inflating latency up to 263% (a 125ms boot → multi-second) — relevant to any A3 fan-out plan.

**Cloudflare is two-tier — only one tier is a substrate.** *Dynamic Workers* = V8 isolates, ~100× faster/cheaper than containers with ms cold starts, but **no full OS** → an A2 deploy target only, never an A1 substrate. *Sandboxes/Containers* (GA 2026) = persistent isolated Linux with PTY, snapshot recovery, filesystem watch, code interpreter, and egress-proxy credential injection → the real Cloudflare fit for **A1/A3**. This is the "Cloudflare Workers can't host the sandbox" myth-bust; see [[crabbox-remote-exec-control-plane]] for Workers used correctly as a control plane.

**Categorization for adoption.** *Primitives* (Firecracker/gVisor) suit teams running their own fleet; *embeddable runtimes* (E2B, microsandbox) add code-exec quickly; *managed platforms* (Modal/Northflank/Daytona) suit data-heavy/GPU/zero-ops. For Open Harness the cheapest, most reversible first experiment is a **gVisor overlay** — a large isolation gain over `--privileged` + host socket for roughly one command's cost.
