# Harness Context

Use this skill when the user asks about Open Harness layout, lifecycle,
conventions, git workflow, or where files live.

## Steps

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for the orchestrator contract — what the root-level
   agent does and does not do.
2. For layout questions, read the per-directory `README.md` files (e.g.
   `.agro/README.md`, `.agro/tasks/README.md`,
   `.agro/scripts/README.md`) plus the nested agent guides
   `.worktrees/AGENTS.md`, `projects/AGENTS.md`, and `crons/AGENTS.md`,
   and the `How the system
   fits together` section of `AGENTS.md`. There is no single comprehensive
   tree — use the filesystem and the directory READMEs.
3. For behavioral norms, now collapsed from an always-on tier into on-demand
   skills, the canonical homes are:
   - `/git` (`.agro/skills/git/SKILL.md`) — issue / branch / commit / PR conventions
   - `/t3` (`.agro/skills/t3/references/sandbox-processes.md`) — tmux sessions for long-running processes
   - `references/directory-readme.md` — when a directory needs a README
   - `/delegate` (`.agro/skills/delegate/SKILL.md`) — wave decomposition and the recursion budget for sub-agents
4. For skill-listing or skill-source-of-truth questions, load `references/skill-source-of-truth.md` and separate the tracked Open Harness shared skill library (`.agro/skills/*/SKILL.md`, exposed through `.claude/skills`, `.codex/skills`, `.pi/skills`, and Hermes' runtime `.hermes/skills/openharness` symlink) from the active Hermes runtime catalog (`.hermes/skills/` plus bundled/profile skills). Do not present `hermes skills list` as the repo source of truth without this distinction.
5. For shared-skill path migrations or cross-agent skill wiring, load `references/shared-skills-symlink-migration.md`; update symlinks, runtime boot setup, docs, CI path filters, cron invocations, exact-path eval probes, and fixed-depth support scripts together before declaring the migration done.
6. For optional sandbox agent/runtime integrations, audit the full runtime/config/auth surface together: compose mounts and env, entrypoint setup/migration, default config seeding, banner sentinels, `.gitignore`, docs/wiki/changelog, and compose config validation. If Hermes is involved, load `references/hermes-state-auth-split.md` for the established single-device project-local runtime (config + auth + sessions all under one `HERMES_HOME`) + shared-skill symlink pattern, and why auth must not be a cross-device symlink.
7. For user-facing optional-runtime warnings, update the user-facing runtime docs/README when the fix is likely to recur. Example: Hermes gateway Slack warnings are covered in `references/hermes-gateway-slack.md`; document that Hermes' Slack gateway is separate from the Pi Slack extension, `hermes-agent[slack]` supplies `slack-bolt`, Open Harness' installed Hermes uses `/usr/local/lib/hermes-agent/venv` (so add extras with `uv pip install --python /usr/local/lib/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python 'hermes-agent[slack]'`, not `uv tool install`), cron still runs without a messaging adapter, and `.hermes/README.md` is the right home for Hermes runtime-home/gateway notes rather than the top-level README. Ownership invariant: runtime paths a human uses inside the container should be writable by the default `sandbox` user; if an image-level install needs root during Docker build, constrain root-owned build paths to that RUN layer and reset runtime env/ownership afterward.
8. Answer with `path:line` citations.

## Output shape

- Short factual answer first, then file references.
- Lifecycle questions (setup / validate / teardown): cite the relevant
  section of `CLAUDE.md`.
- Convention questions: cite the owning skill (`.agro/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`).
