  TRIGGER when: asked to delegate work, execute or parallelize a plan, "run this
  plan", "delegate this", or after /prd or plan creation. Decomposes work by
  dependency, launches bounded provider-native workers in parallel waves, validates
  completion, and reports results while preserving failure isolation and recursion
  limits. Keeps work in the active session when phases share substantial context.

# Delegate

Parallel execution coordinator. Read a plan or conversation context, decompose it into
a dependency-ordered task graph, and spawn worker sub-agents in parallel waves. Each wave
completes before the next begins. Results are collected, validated, and reported.

**Core principle: maximize parallelism while respecting dependencies absolutely.**

## When a worker is justified

> Use a worker only when the task is self-contained and gains from parallelism,
> isolated context, restricted tools, or containment of verbose disposable output.
> Keep work in the active session when phases share substantial context or require
> iterative refinement.

A worker is a **bounded execution context**, not a project role. The active coding
agent is the runtime and stays the owner of the work; skills — `/architect`,
`/spec`, `/audit`, `/retro` — are how it adopts a role. Delegation buys isolation
or parallelism and nothing else.

| Delegate it | Keep it in the active session |
|---|---|
| Independent parallel research or source sweeps | Planning, implementation, and testing that share one evolving picture |
| Verbose disposable output — logs, search dumps, test runs | Work that needs iterative refinement against operator feedback |
| Disjoint file ownership with no shared mutable state | Two tasks that touch the same file |
| A deliberate tool or permission restriction | Anything whose result you would have to re-derive to use |

Do not invent named architectural roles for workers. `/delegate` owns fan-out
policy; other skills must not grow a competing worker hierarchy beside it.

## Worker model and thinking policy

Apply this policy to every worker:

1. **Inherit the parent/session model by default.** Omit the Agent tool's `model`
   argument. Do not route routine or simple work to a weaker model tier.
2. Set the Agent tool's `thinking` parameter from task complexity:
   **simple/mechanical → `low`**, **standard → `medium`**, **complex → `high`**,
   and **architecture or debugging with substantial uncertainty → `xhigh`**.
   Supported levels are `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh`;
   never use `max`.
3. If the selected thinking level is unsupported by the inherited model/provider,
   use the nearest supported level. Do not switch models merely to obtain a thinking
   level.
4. Override `model` only with an explicit task-specific reason: an operator request,
   an unavailable required capability/context, a strict latency or budget constraint,
   or local benchmark evidence. Record that reason in the task graph and pass the
   override only for that worker.

## Instructions

### 1. Resolve input

Arguments received: `$ARGUMENTS`

- If `--plan <path>` is provided, read that file
- If no arguments, use the current conversation context (the plan should be visible
  from a prior `/prd`, plan discussion, or issue triage output)
- If `--dry-run` is present, set DRY_RUN=true

If no plan is found in either source, report:
> No plan found. Provide a plan file path with `--plan <path>` or discuss the plan first, then run `/delegate`.

Run Memory Protocol and stop.

### 2. Decompose into tasks (reason according to complexity)

Analyze the plan deeply and produce a structured task list. For each task, determine:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **ID** | Sequential: T1, T2, T3, ... |
| **Title** | Short imperative description |
| **Description** | What the worker agent needs to do (2-3 sentences, include file paths) |
| **Depends On** | Task IDs this requires first, or "none" |
| **Files** | Key files the worker will read or modify |
| **Complexity** | `simple/mechanical`, `standard`, `complex`, or `architecture/debugging with substantial uncertainty` |
| **Model override** | `none (inherit)` by default; otherwise the exact model plus one allowed explicit reason |
| **Thinking** | `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh`, derived from Complexity and passed as the Agent `thinking` parameter |
| **Acceptance** | How to verify the task is done (objectively checkable) |

**Decomposition rules:**
- Each task must be completable by a single sub-agent in one session
- Prefer more smaller tasks over fewer larger ones
- Schema/infrastructure before backend, backend before frontend
- Tasks that touch different files with no shared state CAN be parallel
- Tasks that modify the same file or depend on another's output MUST be sequential
- Every task must have at least one verifiable acceptance criterion
- Each task must have a **distinct, non-overlapping scope** — do not spawn redundant workers for the same files
- A task that is itself multi-step and parallelizable MAY recursively delegate via the `Agent` tool — but only if the worker's task description includes explicit `Max depth: N` and `Step budget: N` fields (see **Recursion-authorization gate** in step 5). Absent those fields, workers stay flat.

### 3. Build dependency graph and compute waves

Arrange tasks into parallel execution waves using topological ordering:

1. **Wave 1**: All tasks with `Depends On: none` -- run first, in parallel
2. **Wave 2**: All tasks whose dependencies are entirely within Wave 1
3. **Wave N**: All tasks whose dependencies are entirely within Waves 1..N-1

Output the wave plan:

| Wave | Tasks | Parallelism | Complexity |
|------|-------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | T1, T2, T3 | 3 agents | S + S + M |
| 2 | T4, T5 | 2 agents | M + S |
| 3 | T6 | 1 agent | L |

**Validation:**
- No circular dependencies (if found, report error and stop)
- Max 5 concurrent agents per wave (split larger waves into sub-waves)

### 4. Write the run ledger

The task graph is durable state, not conversation state. A delegation outlives a
context window: `/spec execute` compacts mid-build, sessions die, and another agent
can pick up the worktree. Write the graph to disk before spawning any worker.

**Resolve the run directory** as `.agro/tasks/<slug>/`:

- Invoked inside a `/spec execute` task (a `--plan` path under `.agro/tasks/<slug>/`,
  or that folder is the current task): reuse that `<slug>`.
- Otherwise: `delegate-<kebab-topic>-<YYYY-MM-DD>`, created if absent.

**Write two files, both owned by this skill:**

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `delegate-graph.json` | Every task's ID, title, description, `dependsOn`, files, complexity, model override plus its reason, thinking level, acceptance criteria, assigned wave, and `status` (`pending`/`running`/`completed`/`FAIL`/`BLOCKED`) |
| `delegate-log.txt` | Append-only run log; one line per wave boundary and per status change |

Never write `prd.json` or `progress.txt`. Those belong to the implementation owner
(`.agro/tasks/README.md`), and `progress.txt` in particular must not be edited by hand.
This skill's two files sit beside them without collision.

Both live under `.agro/tasks/`, which is gitignored — that is correct for run state.
Stage them with `git add -f` only when a PR must carry the delegation as evidence.

**Resume rather than restart.** If `delegate-graph.json` already exists in the resolved
directory, read it first. Re-run only tasks whose status is `pending`, `FAIL`, or
`BLOCKED`; treat `completed` tasks as done and pass their summaries forward as
prior-wave context. A resumed run appends to `delegate-log.txt`; it never truncates it.

If `--dry-run`, write neither file — output the full task graph and wave plan, then
skip to **Step 7**.

### 5. Execute waves

For each wave, starting from Wave 1:

**a) Spawn worker agents in ONE message (parallel)**

Launch N `Agent` tool calls **in a single message** for parallel execution. Each worker receives:
- Task ID, title, description, files, and acceptance criteria
- Summaries of completed prior-wave results (not full output)
- Instruction: report what was done, what files changed, whether acceptance criteria are met

Worker configuration:
- **Model**: omit the Agent `model` argument so the worker inherits the parent/session
  model. Include `model` only when the task graph records an allowed explicit override
  and its reason; pass that exact override unchanged.
- **Thinking**: pass `thinking` derived from Complexity (`low`, `medium`, `high`,
  or `xhigh`). Never pass `max`. If unsupported, use the nearest supported thinking
  level while keeping the inherited or explicitly overridden model unchanged.
- **run_in_background**: true (for waves with 2+ tasks)
- **subagent_type**: use a **provider-native built-in** type only. This repository defines no project agents, so no `subagent_type` resolves to a repository file. For a worker that must `Write`/`Edit`, use `general-purpose` (or `claude`); for a read-only sweep whose verbose output should stay out of this context, use a read-only built-in such as `Explore`. Verify a type is offered by the running provider before naming it — an unrecognized `subagent_type` either errors or silently degrades. Never name a type on the assumption that a repository agent definition backs it.

**a.1) Recursion-authorization gate**

If any worker's task description authorizes recursive delegation (`Max depth: N` with N ≥ 2), confirm before spawning that **all three** fields are present in that worker's briefing:

This skill owns the triple's semantics; callers cite it rather than forking their own:

- `Max depth: N` counts edges from the root (child = 1, grandchild = 2). A sub-agent MUST NOT recurse when `Max depth` is absent or `1`. A recursing child passes `Max depth: N−1` to its own grandchildren.
- `Max children per level: M` is hard-capped at **5**. A child MUST NOT rewrite a sibling's briefing to lift its own depth or scope.
- `Step budget: S` always reserves at least one final step for the parent's synthesis turn.

These are **prompt-level conventions, not runtime-enforced caps** — nothing rejects a briefing that violates them, so write every briefing to honor them rigorously.

If any field is missing, either add it or downgrade the task to flat execution (`Max depth: 1`). Workers without all three fields MUST stay flat — they have no authority to spawn grandchildren regardless of how the task is described in prose.

**b) Collect results**

After all agents in the wave complete, set each task's `status` and `summary` in
`delegate-graph.json`, then append the wave's outcome to `delegate-log.txt`. Write both
before spawning the next wave — a crash between waves must leave the graph readable.

| Task | Status | Summary | Files Changed |
|------|--------|---------|---------------|
| T1 | completed | Created schema migration | prisma/schema.prisma |
| T2 | completed | Added API route | src/app/api/... |
| T3 | FAIL | Type error in ... | -- |

**c) Handle failures**

If any task fails:
- Log the failure with details
- Check if tasks in subsequent waves depend on the failed task
- Mark dependent tasks as BLOCKED (do not execute them)
- Continue with non-dependent tasks in the next wave

**d) Advance to next wave**

Pass completed task summaries as context to the next wave's workers. Repeat until all waves complete or all remaining tasks are blocked.

### 6. Validate

After all waves complete:

1. Review acceptance criteria for every completed task.
2. Determine validation commands from the plan's acceptance criteria and the target
   repository's own instructions/configuration (for example, its `AGENTS.md`,
   `README.md`, package scripts, Makefile, or CI workflow). Run only commands relevant
   to the changed scope, from that repository's root.
3. Preserve and record each command's real exit status. Do not append `|| true`, pipe
   through a command that masks failure, or substitute hard-coded harness-wide checks.
4. If validation fails, report the command, exit status, and tasks likely responsible.

### 7. Report

Output a structured summary:

```
## Delegation Report

### Task Summary
| Task | Wave | Status | Summary |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| T1   | 1    | DONE   | ...     |
| T2   | 1    | DONE   | ...     |
| T3   | 1    | FAIL   | ...     |
| T4   | 2    | BLOCKED| Depends on T3 |

### Execution Stats
- Total tasks: N
- Completed: N
- Failed: N
- Blocked: N
- Waves executed: N
- Max parallelism: N agents

### Validation
| Command | Scope | Exit status | Result |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|
| `<repo-specific command>` | `<changed scope>` | `<code>` | PASS/FAIL |

### Issues Requiring Attention
- [list any failures, blocked tasks, or validation errors]
```

### 8. Example

For a standard API task, record `Complexity: standard`, `Model override: none
(inherit)`, and `Thinking: medium`; call Agent with `thinking: medium` and no
`model` argument. If `medium` is unsupported, use the nearest supported thinking
level without changing models.

## Reference

### Wave Execution Rules

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Max concurrent agents per wave | 5 (split larger waves) |
| Failure handling | Mark dependent tasks BLOCKED, continue independent ones |
| Context passing | Prior wave summaries, not full output |
| Model selection | Omit Agent `model` to inherit by default. Override only for an operator request, unavailable required capability/context, strict latency/budget, or local benchmark evidence; record the reason. Unsupported thinking falls back to the nearest supported level, never a model switch. |
| Thinking selection | Pass Agent `thinking`: simple/mechanical=`low`; standard=`medium`; complex=`high`; architecture/debugging with substantial uncertainty=`xhigh`; never `max`. |

### Key Resources

| Resource | Path |
|----------|------|
| Write-capable worker | `subagent_type: general-purpose` (or `claude`) — provider built-in |
| Read-only sweep worker | a read-only provider built-in such as `Explore` |
| Worker boundary rule | **When a worker is justified** above |
| Architecture decisions | `/architect` — runs inline, never as a worker identity |

There is **no** repository-authored agent catalog: no `.agro/agents/` pack and no
`.claude/agents/` or `.codex/agents/` provider mirror. Every `subagent_type` above
is a provider built-in with no definition file behind it, so there is no repository
path to cite. A read-only built-in makes zero file changes by design — never assign
one a task that must `Write` or `Edit`.
