  Check the CI pipeline status for the current branch after pushing changes.
  Reports pass/fail with failure details. Use this after every push to confirm
  your changes are truly done — CI must be green.
  TRIGGER when: after git push, after committing changes, when asked to check CI,
  or when verifying that work is complete.

# CI Status

Monitor the GitHub Actions CI pipeline for the current branch. A feature is not done until CI passes.

## Instructions

1. **Identify the current branch, commit, and target repo:**

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
echo "Branch: $BRANCH | Commit: $SHA"

# Repo: explicit --repo owner/name, else derive from the current checkout's origin.
# gh repo view resolves the checkout's origin remote — the repo where the branch/PR lives.
# To override (e.g. when testing against a different fork), set REPO_OVERRIDE=owner/name.
if [ -n "$REPO_OVERRIDE" ]; then
  case "$REPO_OVERRIDE" in
    */*) REPO="$REPO_OVERRIDE" ;;
    *) echo "ERROR: --repo must be owner/name format (got '$REPO_OVERRIDE')"; exit 1 ;;
  esac
else
  REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner)
fi
[ -n "$REPO" ] || { echo "ERROR: could not derive repo — is gh authenticated? Try: gh auth login"; exit 1; }
echo "Repo: $REPO"
```

2. **Prefer an open PR's checks (PR-first path):**

Derive the PR number for the current branch. When multiple open PRs share the head branch (stacked PRs), the first/most-recent is used. An empty `PR_NUMBER` means no open PR and routes to the branch-runs fallback in steps 3–6.

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr list --head "$BRANCH" --state open --repo "$REPO" \
  --json number --jq '.[0].number')

if [ -n "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
  echo "Open PR found: #$PR_NUMBER — checking PR checks directly"
  gh pr checks "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$REPO"
  # Also available: gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$REPO" --json statusCheckRollup
  # If gh pr checks returns no rows, report NO-RUN (see step 7 — no checks were triggered).
  # Exit here if the PR checks output is definitive (pass/fail visible).
  # Otherwise fall through to the branch-runs fallback below for more detail.
else
  echo "No open PR for branch $BRANCH — using branch-runs fallback"
fi
```

3. **No-PR fallback: find the latest CI run for this branch:**

```bash
gh api "repos/$REPO/actions/runs?branch=$BRANCH&per_page=1" \
  --jq '.workflow_runs[0] | {id: .id, status: .status, conclusion: .conclusion, head_sha: .head_sha[:7], name: .name}'
```

4. **If the run is still in progress, poll every 15 seconds (max 5 minutes):**

```bash
RUN_ID=<id from step 3>
for i in $(seq 1 20); do
  STATUS=$(gh api "repos/$REPO/actions/runs/$RUN_ID" --jq '.status')
  if [ "$STATUS" = "completed" ]; then
    break
  fi
  echo "Still running... ($i/20)"
  sleep 15
done
```

5. **Check the result:**

```bash
gh api "repos/$REPO/actions/runs/$RUN_ID" \
  --jq '{status: .status, conclusion: .conclusion, url: .html_url}'
```

6. **If failed, get the failure details:**

```bash
# Get the failed job ID
JOB_ID=$(gh api "repos/$REPO/actions/runs/$RUN_ID/jobs" \
  --jq '.jobs[] | select(.conclusion == "failure") | .id')

# Get the failure context (15 lines before the error)
gh api "repos/$REPO/actions/jobs/$JOB_ID/logs" 2>&1 \
  | grep -B 15 "Process completed with exit code" | head -25
```

For Eval Probe Regression Gate failures, immediately inspect the failed probe name from the log and run that probe locally. If the product behavior intentionally changed, patch the probe to assert the durable invariant instead of an obsolete exact literal; otherwise fix the product/skill/docs that regressed. Then amend/commit, push, and re-run PR checks.

7. **Report the result:**

- **PASS**: Report "CI green" with the run URL
- **FAIL**: Report the failing step, error message, and suggest a fix. Then fix the issue, commit, push, and run `/ci-status` again
- **NO RUN**: No workflow's `on:` filter matched the push, or `PR_NUMBER` was set but `gh pr checks` returned no rows (the PR exists but no workflows were triggered yet). *(Note: the workflow names below reflect this harness's layout and may differ in other checkouts.)*
  - `ci-harness.yml` — push only: `packages/**`, `.agro/**`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, itself
  - Docs site CI/deploy lives in `mifunedev/agro-web`; this repo has no `docs.yml` Docusaurus workflow.
  - `release.yml` — every push to `main` or `master`; validation precedes automatic release publication

  Infrastructure-only PRs (devcontainer/scripts/install/) trigger NOTHING on push — that's expected. `pull_request`-event workflows still fire when the PR opens. Diagnose with: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD` and compare against each workflow's `on:` block.

## CI Pipeline Steps

*(Note: the steps below reflect this harness's CI layout and may differ in other checkouts.)*

This project's CI (`CI: Harness`) runs these steps in order:

1. Lint (`pnpm run lint`)
2. Format check (`pnpm run format:check`)
3. Type check (`pnpm run type-check`)
4. Prisma generate (`pnpm exec prisma generate`)
5. Prisma migrate (`npx prisma migrate deploy`)
6. Build (`pnpm run build`)
7. Test (`pnpm test`)
8. Playwright E2E (`pnpm run test:e2e`)

## Local Pre-flight

Before pushing, you can run the same checks locally to catch issues early:

```bash
pnpm -r run lint && pnpm -r run format:check && pnpm -r run build && pnpm -r run test
```
