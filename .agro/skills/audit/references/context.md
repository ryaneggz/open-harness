# Context Audit

Score every file in the default-loaded context set on 4 deterministic dimensions (footprint, load-bearing, integrity, redundancy). Emit KEEP / TRIM / DEMOTE / CUT verdicts and a total token budget.

## Default-Loaded Set

| Layer | Files | Loaded how |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Bootloader | `AGENTS.md` (`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it) | always |
| Skill metadata | frontmatter of all `**/SKILL.md` | always injected |

## Instructions

### 1. Parse arguments

Arguments received: `$ARGUMENTS`

| Argument | Mode |
|----------|------|
| empty or `all` | Scorecard only |
| `--baseline` | Scorecard + write an ephemeral baseline snapshot under `$TMPDIR/oh-context-audit/YYYY-MM-DD/` |

### 2. Inventory the default-loaded set

```bash
HARNESS=$AUDIT_ROOT
TODAY=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)

# Enumerate all files and their footprint
for f in "$HARNESS/AGENTS.md"; do
  [ -f "$f" ] || continue
  chars=$(wc -c < "$f")
  words=$(wc -w < "$f")
  echo "$((chars/4)) $words $f"
done

# Skill metadata aggregate (all SKILL.md description fields)
skill_chars=$(grep -h -A10 '^description:' \
  "$HARNESS"/.agro/skills/*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null \
  | wc -c)
echo "$((skill_chars/4)) skill-metadata-aggregate (all trigger descriptions)"
```

Collect the list as `ALL_FILES` for use in the scoring steps below.

### 3. Score each file on 4 dimensions

For every file in the inventory (skip the skill-metadata aggregate row — no verdict, budget line only), compute 4 dimensions using shell commands only.

---

#### Dimension A — Footprint (0-2)

Token cost (chars/4). Lower cost earns a higher score — every token in the default-loaded set is paid on every session start.

```bash
TOKENS=$(($(wc -c < "$f") / 4))
```

| Tokens | Score |
|--------|-------|
| < 500 | 2 |
| 500 – 1,500 | 1 |
| > 1,500 | 0 |

---

#### Dimension B — Load-bearing (0-2)

Citation count: how many skills, tracked docs, and orchestrator files reference this file by name (a measurable proxy for "this content is actively consumed").

```bash
FILE_BASE=$(basename "$f")
REFS=$(grep -rl "$FILE_BASE" \
  "$HARNESS/.agro/skills" \
  "$HARNESS/AGENTS.md" \
  "$HARNESS/docs" 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -v "^${f}$" | wc -l)
```

| Citations | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| >= 5 | 2 |
| 1 – 4 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 |

---

#### Dimension C — Integrity (0-2)

Verify that every file path and skill reference within the file resolves. Broken references are load-bearing context that actively misleads.

```bash
# Repo-relative .agro/ paths referenced in backticks or quotes. Do not interpret
# command invocations (for example /audit) as filesystem-root paths.
PATH_REFS=$(grep -oP '`[^`]+`|"[^"]+"' "$f" \
  | grep -oP '(?:^|[[:space:]`"])(\.agro/[a-zA-Z0-9_./-]+)' \
  | grep -oP '\.agro/[a-zA-Z0-9_./-]+' | sort -u)

# Skill invocations like /release, /ci-status (exclude filesystem paths)
SKILL_REFS=$(grep -oP '/[a-z][a-z0-9-]+' "$f" \
  | grep -v '^/home' | sort -u)

BROKEN=0
for p in $PATH_REFS; do
  [ -e "$HARNESS/$p" ] || BROKEN=$((BROKEN + 1))
done
for s in $SKILL_REFS; do
  name="${s#/}"
  [ -d "$HARNESS/.agro/skills/$name" ] || BROKEN=$((BROKEN + 1))
done
```

| Broken refs | Score |
|-------------|-------|
| 0 | 2 |
| 1 – 2 | 1 |
| 3+ | 0 |

---

#### Dimension D — Redundancy (0-2)

Check whether this file's section-header structure substantially duplicates another loaded file. Redundant files add cost without adding unique signal.

```bash
HEADS=$(grep '^## ' "$f" | sed 's/^## //')
OVERLAP=0
for other in $ALL_FILES; do
  [ "$other" = "$f" ] && continue
  [ -f "$other" ] || continue
  match=$(grep '^## ' "$other" | sed 's/^## /' \
    | grep -cFf <(echo "$HEADS") 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  [ "$match" -gt 2 ] && OVERLAP=$((OVERLAP + 1))
done
```

| Overlap files | Score |
|---------------|-------|
| 0 | 2 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2+ | 0 |

---

### 4. Compute total and verdict

```
TOTAL = A + B + C + D  (max 8)
```

| Total | Verdict | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 7 – 8 | **KEEP** | Signal justified; no action needed |
| 5 – 6 | **TRIM** | Reduce footprint or remove duplicate sections; stays default-loaded |
| 3 – 4 | **DEMOTE** | Move to on-demand (session-start explicit read or skill); remove from auto-load |
| 0 – 2 | **CUT** | Not earning its slot; remove or merge. |

### 5. Emit the report

Print today's date as `YYYY-MM-DD`.

```
## Context Audit — YYYY-MM-DD

### Budget
Total default-loaded (scored files): X tokens
Skill metadata aggregate: ~Y tokens
Grand total: ~Z tokens

### Scorecard
| File | Tokens | A:Foot | B:Load | C:Integ | D:Redun | Total | Verdict |
|------|-------:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|------:|---------|
| ...  |        |        |        |         |         |       |         |

(sorted by Total ascending — worst first)

### Recommendations
- **CUT**: <file> — <one-line reason>
- **DEMOTE**: <file> — <one-line reason>
- **TRIM**: <file> — <one-line reason>
```

Omit KEEP files from Recommendations. Use the short filename (e.g. `advisor.md`), not the full path.

### 6. Memory Protocol

Return a structured context observation carrying `AUDIT_RUN_ID`, budget, top finding, and
evidence path. Do not report a run record from this route; the outer dispatcher prints the
one terminal run record.

## Guidelines

- All scoring is deterministic — same shell commands twice produce the same scores. No LLM judgment.
- The skill-metadata aggregate row gets a budget line but no verdict (it's aggregate; verdicts apply per-file only).
- When `--baseline` mode is used, probe outputs are written under `$TMPDIR/oh-context-audit/YYYY-MM-DD/`. That is ephemeral scratch outside the repo — copy a baseline out if you need to keep it.
- Do not penalize `AGENTS.md` on Dimension B (load-bearing) because it's the source of truth and may have few inbound citations by design — it doesn't need to be cited; it is the orchestrator instructions.

## Reference

### Verdict thresholds

| Score | Verdict | Recommended action |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| 7–8 | KEEP | No action |
| 5–6 | TRIM | Edit for concision; remove duplicate sections |
| 3–4 | DEMOTE | Move to on-demand; remove from auto-load set |
| 0–2 | CUT | Remove or merge |

### Probe file format

```yaml
---
name: <identifier>
target: <rule-filename>   # which default-loaded file this probe exercises
markers:
  - <keyword or phrase that should appear when the rule is present>
  - ...
---

<Prompt text — what gets sent to claude -p. One task that requires the target rule to answer correctly.>
```
