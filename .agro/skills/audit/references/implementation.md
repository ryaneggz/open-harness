# Audit implementation — per-unit verdict gate

The **audit** gate, composed by `/spec execute` in `.agro/skills/spec/SKILL.md`. It answers
one question: *does this one implementation satisfy its task graph and is it
promotable?* — and emits exactly one verdict the caller routes on.

**Core principle: compose, don't re-derive — and never infer green from silence.**
This skill owns the *verdict*, not the checks. Each gate below is an existing
primitive; `/audit implementation` runs them in fail-fast order and integrates their results
into a single `AUDIT-PASS` / `AUDIT-FAIL`. It is **read-only**: it decides, it
does not mutate (no `gh pr ready`, no `gh pr merge`) and does not fix — promotion
is a downstream concern and remediation belongs to the build step on
`AUDIT-FAIL` (single-owner handoff: the outcome is decided here, acted on elsewhere).

> **Not a survey target.** `/audit prs` triages the *whole* open-PR queue in one
> bulk query (*"never loop per-PR"*, `audit/references/prs.md`); `/audit implementation`
> is the opposite shape — a single unit (1 impl vs. 1 `prd.json`). It consumes the
> same focused classifier used by `/audit pr`; it does not replace or fork it.

## Inputs

| Arg | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `<slug>` | The task slug — locates `.agro/tasks/<slug>/prd.json` and `.agro/tasks/<slug>/progress.txt`. Required. |
| `--pr <N>` | The PR for this unit, if one exists. When set, gate 3 uses the shared focused classifier (which reads `statusCheckRollup`, subsuming `/ci-status`). |
| `--repo <owner/name>` | Repository passed unchanged to focused PR acquisition. Required with `--pr`; never inferred from the process checkout or a hard-coded default. |
| `--base <branch>` | Expected PR base for focused classification. Defaults to `development`; set it to the parent branch for a stacked PR. |
| `--branch <branch>` | The work branch. Used by gate 3's `/ci-status` fallback when there is no PR yet (e.g. an autopilot pre-PR audit). Defaults to the current branch. |

## The five gates (fail-fast, in order)

Run in order; the **first** gate that fails decides the verdict (`AUDIT-FAIL`,
naming the gate). Only when **all** applicable gates pass is the verdict
`AUDIT-PASS`. A gate whose signal is missing or ambiguous is a FAIL, never a pass
(honest exits).

### Gate 1 — Task-graph conformance + artifact contract

Gate 1 has **two gating sub-checks**; either failing is an `AUDIT-FAIL`. Execute
the production helper `"$AUDIT_ROOT/.agro/skills/audit/scripts/implementation-gates.sh" gate1 "$SLUG"`;
the snippets below explain its behavior and are not a second implementation.

**(a) Task-graph conformance.** Every user story in the task graph must be marked
complete. The implementation owner flips `passes: false → true` only after validating each story, so
the graph is conformant only when **zero** stories remain unfinished:

```bash
SLUG="$1"; PRD="$AUDIT_ROOT/.agro/tasks/$SLUG/prd.json"
[ -f "$PRD" ] || { echo "FAIL gate1: no $PRD"; exit 1; }
unfinished=$(jq '[.userStories[] | select(.passes != true)] | length' "$PRD")
total=$(jq '.userStories | length' "$PRD")
echo "task-graph: $((total - unfinished))/$total stories pass"
[ "$unfinished" -eq 0 ] || { echo "FAIL gate1: $unfinished story(ies) not passing"; exit 1; }
```

**(b) Artifact contract.** If the `prd.json` declares an `artifact_contract` block
(see the [artifact-contract schema](../../../../docs/artifact-contract-schema.md)), every
path in `artifact_contract.required_artifacts` must exist on disk. This is a
**gating** sub-check — a declared-but-missing artifact is a hard `AUDIT-FAIL`, not
an advisory warning. The block is **optional and additive**: a `prd.json` with no
`artifact_contract` key yields an empty list and passes this sub-check unchanged,
so the gate keeps its pre-contract behavior for specs that declare no contract:

```bash
# Gating: a declared required_artifact that is absent on disk fails Gate 1.
# Optional block — no .artifact_contract ⇒ empty list ⇒ unchanged pass.
while IFS= read -r artifact; do
  [ -z "$artifact" ] && continue
  case "$artifact" in /*) echo "FAIL gate1: artifact must be AUDIT_ROOT-relative: $artifact"; exit 1;; esac
  artifact_path="$AUDIT_ROOT/$artifact"
  resolved=$(realpath -e -- "$artifact_path") || exit 1
  [ "$resolved" = "$artifact_path" ] && case "$resolved" in "$AUDIT_ROOT"/*) :;; *) false;; esac \
    || { echo "FAIL gate1: required_artifact is non-canonical, symlinked, or outside AUDIT_ROOT: $artifact"; exit 1; }
done < <(jq -r '.artifact_contract.required_artifacts // [] | .[]' "$PRD")
```

A non-conformant graph **or** a missing required artifact is `AUDIT-FAIL` →
`implement` (resume the unfinished stories, or produce the promised artifact). Do
not advance to the later gates. A worked fixture proving the artifact sub-check
fails on a missing path lives at
[`../fixtures/artifact-contract.prd.json`](../fixtures/artifact-contract.prd.json)
(exercised by `.agro/evals/probes/artifact-contract-audit.sh`).

### Gate 2 — Regression floor (`/eval`)

The probe suite must stay green for this change. Gate on the runner's **exit code +
delta**, not its prose.

**Read the cycle's result before running the suite.** `/spec execute` runs `/eval` once
per cycle and publishes `.agro/tasks/<slug>/eval-result.json`. Reuse it **only while it
describes the code under test** — that is, while its `commit` equals the current
`HEAD`:

```bash
RESULT=".agro/tasks/<slug>/eval-result.json"
if [ -f "$RESULT" ] && [ "$(jq -r .commit "$RESULT")" = "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" ]; then
  rc="$(jq -r .runnerExit "$RESULT")"          # inherit the cycle's single run
else
  AUDIT_RUN_ID="$AUDIT_RUN_ID" AUDIT_ROOT="$AUDIT_ROOT" \
    bash "$AUDIT_ROOT/.agro/skills/eval/run.sh" ; rc=$?
fi
# rc=0 → no NEW green→red regression for this commit (pass)
# rc=1 → at least one new regression (FAIL gate2)
```

The commit check is what keeps the reuse honest: the moment the branch moves, the
record describes code that is no longer under test, and this gate runs the suite
itself rather than inheriting a stale green. **Never** reuse a record whose `commit`
you did not compare, and never treat a missing record as a pass.

Block only on a **new** `green→red` regression or a non-zero runner exit. A
pre-existing red with an unchanged delta is non-gating but MUST be disclosed in
the verdict. (Mirrors `/spec execute`'s `/eval` gate and `.agro/evals/probes/eval-gate.sh`.)

### Gate 3 — Promotable / CI state

The implementation must be promotable: CI green **and** (for a PR) mergeable and
clean.

- **PR exists (`--pr N --repo O/N`):** invoke
  `"$AUDIT_ROOT/.agro/skills/audit/scripts/implementation-gates.sh" classify-pr "$REPO" "$PR" "$BASE"`.
  That production helper calls the shared acquisition and classifier and returns
  their fresh JSON. Consume only
  `.promotable`, `.readyForReview`, `.readyToMerge`, and `.evidenceComplete`.
  Pass only when evidence is complete and promotable; `NONE` and `UNKNOWN` fail.
  Never parse Markdown or a human routing token. The acquisition reads
  `statusCheckRollup`, so do not also poll CI.
- **No PR yet:** fall back to `/ci-status` on `--branch`. A `NO-RUN` CI status is
  **not** a pass (no run ≠ green) — that is `AUDIT-FAIL` until a run is dispatched
  and lands green.

### Gate 4 — UI verification (conditional)

If the task graph contains any browser-verification criteria, the UI must be
confirmed visually:

```bash
grep -qi "agent-browser\|Verify in browser" "$AUDIT_ROOT/.agro/tasks/$SLUG/prd.json" && echo "UI gate applies"
```

Determine applicability with the production helper's `browser-required` mode. When
it applies, run its `browser-preflight` mode directly (do **not** run the ordinary
`/agent-browser` repair/install preflight): it requires `command -v agent-browser`
and a successful `agent-browser --version`, create a profile beneath
`$AUDIT_TMP_ROOT`, launch only `about:blank` in session `audit-$AUDIT_RUN_ID`, then
close that session and remove the profile. Set `HOME` to that profile for all
preflight commands. The preflight must not install/download/repair, navigate to the
application, write anywhere under `AUDIT_ROOT`, or touch GitHub; compare
compare status, tracked content, index, and untracked-content snapshots before/after and fail on any delta (including changes to files that were already dirty).
Failure fails Gate 4 before application navigation. After a successful preflight,
drive `/agent-browser` against the running app and confirm the acceptance criteria
render/behave as specified. Store screenshots under `$AUDIT_TMP_ROOT`, not in the
repository. No clean screenshot/snapshot for an applicable story is `AUDIT-FAIL`.
When no story declares browser verification, this gate is **not applicable** and
must not invoke `agent-browser` at all.

### Gate 5 — Slop (less code, low complexity)

The correctness gates above prove the change *works*. None of them can fail a change
that works and is twice the size it needed to be. This gate asks the one question that
closes that hole:

> **Can this diff be smaller and still satisfy every acceptance criterion in `prd.json`?**

While the answer is yes, the verdict is `AUDIT-FAIL` and the build simplifies. The goal
stays one sentence on purpose — the ingenuity belongs in the execution, not in the
objective. Less code is less code to maintain and fewer places for a bug to live.

**Signals.** Run
`"$AUDIT_ROOT/.agro/skills/audit/scripts/implementation-gates.sh" slop-metrics "$BASE"`,
which emits one JSON object. Report every number in the verdict:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `netAdded` / `netRemoved` | Lines the unit's diff adds and removes vs. `--base`, excluding lockfiles, `.agro/evals/RESULTS.md`, and symlinked provider mirrors. `netAdded` is the headline number the loop drives down. |
| `tsOverCcn` | Functions in the changed `.ts`/`.js`/`.mjs` files over `ccnMax` (default 10), from `uvx lizard`. **Real per-function cyclomatic complexity.** |
| `shBranchPoints` | The *net* change in branch tokens across changed `.sh` files. No complexity tool parses bash, so this is an explicit **proxy** — never report it as CCN. |
| `tool` | `lizard <version>`, `lizard n/a (no analysable files changed)`, or `unavailable`. |

`tool: unavailable` means `uvx lizard` could not resolve (an offline runner). The
complexity signal is then **SKIPPED and disclosed** — an empty `tsOverCcn` from an
unavailable tool is never reported as a clean complexity result. Never infer green from
silence.

**Findings — the termination rule.** Every finding MUST cite `file:line`, name the
concrete simpler alternative, and state the lines it removes. **A finding with no
concrete simpler alternative is not a finding.** That rule is what keeps this gate an
engineering check rather than an unbounded argument about taste. Typical shapes: a
primitive the repo already has, an abstraction with exactly one call site and no
criterion requiring it, a new file where editing an existing one would do, a path no
story exercises.

A finding is **blocking** only when its alternative satisfies every acceptance criterion
with no new work. Anything else is disclosed, non-gating. A function the diff
*introduces* above `ccnMax` is blocking; one already over the threshold on the base is
disclosed only — the same pre-existing/new distinction gate 2 makes.

**The bounded, monotone loop.** Read the caller's round record with
`implementation-gates.sh simplicity-round "$SLUG"`, which prints
`rounds=<n> cap=3 escalate=<bool> prevNetAdded=<n|none>` from
`.agro/tasks/<slug>/simplify-rounds.json`:

- `escalate=false` and a blocking finding exists → `AUDIT-FAIL` (gate 5). The build
  simplifies and re-audits.
- `escalate=true` (round cap reached), **or** `netAdded` did not strictly fall below
  `prevNetAdded` on this round → stop blocking. `prevNetAdded=none` is the first round:
  there is nothing to compare, so the monotone rule does not apply to it. The loop ends when the diff can no
  longer be made smaller, not when taste is satisfied, so it terminates by construction.
  Emit `AUDIT-PASS` with `SIMPLICITY-RESIDUAL: <n>` and list the residual findings for
  the operator; they belong in `evidence.md`.

This route **reads** the round record. It never writes or increments it — the
orchestrating caller owns that file, exactly as it owns `evidence.md`.

---

## Verdict

| All applicable gates pass | Any gate fails |
|---|---|
| `AUDIT-PASS` → `retro` | `AUDIT-FAIL` → `implement` (resume) |

State the verdict, then — on the **final line** — emit the routing token. Always
name the deciding gate on `AUDIT-FAIL` and disclose any non-gating pre-existing
red from gate 2. An `AUDIT-PASS` reached at the gate-5 round cap or on a
non-reducing round carries `SIMPLICITY-RESIDUAL: <n>` with the residual findings;
a `PASS` that hides residual slop is the one thing this gate exists to prevent.

---

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Mutate PR state.** No `gh pr ready`, no `gh pr merge`, no labels. The verdict
  is read-only; undrafting/merging is a separate, downstream decision.
- **Fix anything.** Remediation is the `implement` node's job on `AUDIT-FAIL`.
- **Fork PR classification.** It consumes the same private classifier JSON as
  `/audit pr` and `/audit prs`.
- **Re-run a passing gate.** Fail-fast: stop at the first failing gate.
- **Write or increment the gate-5 round counter.** It reads
  `.agro/tasks/<slug>/simplify-rounds.json`; the orchestrating caller writes it.
- **Apply the simplification.** Gate 5 names the smaller alternative; removing the
  code is the `implement` node's job, like every other `AUDIT-FAIL`.
- **Write the reviewer evidence doc.** The per-gate observations above are what
  `.agro/tasks/<slug>/evidence.md` is built from, but the orchestrating caller writes and
  commits it — see [`reviewer-evidence-doc.md`](reviewer-evidence-doc.md).

## Memory Protocol

Return this structured observation to the outer dispatcher; do not report a run record from this route. The dispatcher prints the one terminal run record:

```markdown
## audit -- HH:MM UTC
- **Result**: OP
- **Unit**: <slug> (PR #<N> / branch <branch>)
- **Verdict**: AUDIT-PASS | AUDIT-FAIL (gate <n>: <reason>)
- **Gates**: graph <p/t> · eval <rc> · promotable <class> · ui <pass|n/a> · slop +<netAdded>/-<netRemoved> (<clean|blocking n|residual n>)
- **Observation**: <one sentence>
```
