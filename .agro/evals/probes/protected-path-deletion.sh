# source: .agro/tasks/spec-simplification/ (issue #816, US-001) — the critique gate was deleted,
#         and with it the ONE deterministic check it carried: cross-check proposed deletions
#         against .claude/protected-paths.txt and halt on a hit. PR #212 deleted six
#         load-bearing skills under a defensible-sounding rationale and it took two weeks to
#         surface (.agro/agents/critic.md:41). Nothing inherited that property.
# desc: a protected path may be deleted, but never silently. Intersect this branch's deletions
#       with .claude/protected-paths.txt AS OF THE MERGE BASE — the one version an in-PR
#       amendment cannot edit — and require every hit to be named verbatim in a task
#       evidence.md. Removing the path and its list entry in the same commit keeps
#       protected-paths-resolve.sh green, so that probe cannot see this failure.
