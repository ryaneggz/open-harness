# source: issue #753 — .claude/protected-paths.txt named 7 paths that did not exist.
#         `cloudflared-tunnel` was listed while the skill is `cloudflared`, so
#         /cloudflared had no protection at all; four `spec-*` entries had never been
#         directories (the dispatcher implements them as spec/references/*.md);
#         `.agro/install/cloudflared-tunnel.sh` was deleted; and
#         `.claude/specs/structure-spec-v0.7.md` sat under a gitignored path
#         (.gitignore:66) that could never resolve. A guard entry that matches nothing
#         protects nothing AND reads identical to one that passes, so a rename
#         silently disarms it. Only a resolution check catches the next one.
# desc: every entry in .claude/protected-paths.txt resolves to a file or directory
#       that exists, so a rename cannot silently disarm a protection
