# source: retro lesson 2026-09-01 (issue #926) — a probe carrying `&>2` wrote a file named 2
#         into the repository root on every suite run, for hours, while the suite reported
#         all-green; it reached git through a merge commit
# desc: no probe writes into the repository — no `&>N` file redirect, no redirect targeting a
#       path under $ROOT — and no redirect residue is tracked at the repository root.
#       This is a STATIC guard plus a residue check, deliberately narrow: it cannot run the
#       suite to observe writes without recursing into itself, and a broad "any relative
#       redirect" scan is unusable noise (shell comparisons, prose arrows, and heredocs
#       written inside mktemp directories all match it).

# inside its own mktemp directory, which makes it noise rather than a check.
# $AUDIT_ROOT is deliberately NOT anchored: it is invocation-scoped by contract, and
# probes legitimately point it at a mktemp fixture they created.
