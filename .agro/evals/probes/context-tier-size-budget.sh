# tier: A
# source: .agro/tasks/spec-simplification/ (issue #816, US-007) — the always-on tier was 85,256 B
#         / ~21,300 tokens, and nothing stopped it growing: every session appends, no session
#         deletes. Issue #868 collapsed the tier to AGENTS.md alone.
# desc: the single always-loaded context file AGENTS.md stays inside a declared byte budget.
#       This is a RATCHET, not a measurement: AGENTS.md is read in full by every session before
#       any work begins, so growth here is a tax on every future run. The budget is deliberately
#       set just above today's size — the point is that regrowth must be a decision someone makes
#       by editing this number, not something that happens by accumulation.
