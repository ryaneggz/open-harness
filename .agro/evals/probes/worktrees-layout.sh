# source: issue #872
# desc: a repository keeps its worktrees at its own root in .worktrees/, and
#       non-harness clones live at projects/<owner>/<repo>/. Both roots are
#       gitignored except a tracked AGENTS.md guide and its CLAUDE.md
#       provider-compatibility symlink, the retired
#       .agro/worktrees/ root is gone, and the layout is a fixed convention:
#       WORKTREES_DIR / PROJECTS_DIR / CRONS_DIR are retired and cannot move
#       any of these roots.
