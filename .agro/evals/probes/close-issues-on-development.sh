# source: issue #841 (closing keywords never fire because the default branch is main) 2026-08-26
# desc: the development-merge issue closer must stay merged-only, development-only, least-privilege,
#       and on the pull_request trigger — pull_request_target resolves from the default branch,
#       where this workflow does not exist, so it would never fire.
