# tier: A
# source: .agro/tasks/spec-simplification/ (issue #816, US-006) — /eval ran 3x per cycle on the
#         same commit: 318 probe executions to learn one thing.
# desc: the probe suite runs ONCE per cycle. /spec execute runs it and publishes
#       .agro/tasks/<slug>/eval-result.json keyed to the commit it ran against; /audit
#       implementation Gate 2 and /benchmark Signal 1 READ that record instead of re-running.
#       Both readers must compare `commit` against HEAD before reusing it — inheriting a
#       record from an earlier HEAD would report a floor that was never measured — and
#       neither may treat a missing record as a pass.
