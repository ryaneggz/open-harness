# source: #920 — the epic #903→#911 made the CLI provision harnesses and tools from
#         agro.json, but compose kept pushing eleven of the same settings through
#         .devcontainer/.env. That left two installers for agent-browser and Tailscale
#         with duplicated version and sha256 pins, and left flavor B silently without
#         any Hermes wiring because it never carried INSTALL_HERMES.
# desc: a value belongs in a compose environment: block only if a process OUTSIDE the
#       sandbox — or the entrypoint BEFORE the control plane is readable — must act on
#       it. Across every .devcontainer/docker-compose*.yml including overlays: no
#       INSTALL_* key, no OH_IMAGE_ONLY, and every environment: key is either rendered
#       by config-render.ts or one of the documented literals. ports: and volumes: are
#       unrestricted — that payload is the part only Docker can act on.
