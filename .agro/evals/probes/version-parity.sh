# source: conversation 2026-08-29 — the oh CLI became the only lifecycle door, so its
#         npm version is the only version a user can see, and it had drifted two minors
#         behind the harness while release.yml no-opped silently on the stale tag
# desc: the root package.json version, the .agro/cli package.json version, the
#       .agro/cli/legacy package.json version and its exact @mifune/agro pin, and a dated
#       CHANGELOG heading for that version all agree, so a release publishes the CLI
#       the harness ships, the @mifune/openharness shim delegates to the bundle cut with
#       it, and reserve-github-release.mjs cannot classify the push as already-released
#       and skip the image, the npm publish, and the GitHub release.
