# desc: the eval gate keys on the green→red delta + the runner exit code, never on the bare
#       presence of a REGRESSION row. The rule lives with whoever RUNS the gate: that moved
#       from autopilot §6 to the build path's own /eval gate in spec-simplification US-002,
#       and moved again with that path when /ship-spec was absorbed into /spec execute (US-003).
#       Issue #816. The autopilot half of this assertion was dropped in 0.3.0 when autopilot
#       was removed; the rule is asserted on /spec execute, its sole owner and runner.
