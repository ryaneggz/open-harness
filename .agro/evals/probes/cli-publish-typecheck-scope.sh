# source: release run 33271077312 — v0.5.0 pushed its GHCR image, then failed to publish
#         the CLI to npm: prepublishOnly runs typecheck:build, which pulled in
#         src/lib/__tests__/*.test.ts because tsconfig.build.json excluded only
#         src/__tests__/**, and vitest is a workspace-root dependency that the publish
#         environment does not install
# desc: every CLI test file lives under a __tests__/ directory, and
#       .agro/cli/tsconfig.build.json excludes all of them. Running the typecheck cannot
#       catch this: at the workspace root vitest resolves and it passes, so the failure
#       appears only when npm installs .agro/cli alone. The scope is asserted statically.
