# source: retro lesson 2026-09-01 (issue #926) — evidence.md recorded an acceptance criterion
#         as satisfied by an openharness-web follow-up that had not been filed; every internal
#         gate passed and external verification caught it
# desc: the reviewer evidence contract requires a follow-up to be CITED, not named, and every
#       tracked evidence.md that leans on a follow-up carries a resolvable issue/PR URL in the
#       same bullet. No gate inside this repository can see an artifact in another one, so the
#       citation is the only thing separating "deferred" from "done".
