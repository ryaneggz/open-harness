# source: issue #98; issue #225 (restart-required cron frontmatter/config drift)
# desc: extract the LIVE Step C-2 bash block from /audit drift and RUN it
#       against fixtures (README-style, valid scheduled cron, disabled cron,
#       missing schedule, empty schedules, invalid schedule, invalid id,
#       id mismatch, unsafe agent) with RUNTIME_START before their mtimes; PASS
#       only if the inert set includes the valid cron and excludes invalid
#       runtime-config fixtures.
#       This is a behavioral extract-and-run probe (not a text-presence grep): a
#       revert of Step C-2 to the raw `for f in crons/*.md` glob flags all
#       fixtures and flips the probe to REGRESSION.
