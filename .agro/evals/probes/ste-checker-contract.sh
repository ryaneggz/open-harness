# source: issue #750 PR audit — the /ste checker had four fail-open paths (unclosed
#         fence, unterminated frontmatter, mismatched fence markers, an unknown
#         --blocks tag), each of which exited 0 while scanning nothing. A linter
#         that passes by scanning nothing is worse than no linter, because the
#         green exit is read as proof. Nothing in CI executed the script, so every
#         guarantee in .agro/tasks/ste-controlled-language/verify.sh was hand-run only.
# desc: the /ste checker rejects as well as accepts — it exits 1 on the committed
#       before-fixture with all six detector classes, exits 0 on its own corpus,
#       and refuses to pass vacuously on any of the four known fail-open shapes
