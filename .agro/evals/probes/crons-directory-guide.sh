# desc: crons/ carries its operating contract as AGENTS.md, because a cron body
#       is an agent prompt executed unattended rather than prose a human reads.
#       The guide must be present, must document the frontmatter contract and
#       the reload rules that decide when an edit takes effect, and must itself
#       be inert — the runtime's predicate must never schedule it as a cron.
