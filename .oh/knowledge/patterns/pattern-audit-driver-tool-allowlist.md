# A non-interactive audit driver without a tool allowlist reports every gate as unobtainable

## Relevant Source Files
- `.oh/skills/audit/SKILL.md` — the shipped driver example, `["claude","-p","--output-format","text"]`, carries no tool allowlist.
- `.oh/skills/audit/scripts/route-driver.sh` — appends the route prompt as positional arguments after the command array.
- `.oh/tasks/one-door/evidence.md` — the run that hit it: two failed audits, one pass.

## Summary
**Retired 2026-09-06 (#993, PR #991).** Issue #993 replaced the nested-agent
driver: `route-driver.sh` now runs the deterministic gates itself and launches no
agent. The allowlist failure mode below no longer exists. This page stays as the
record of why the driver changed.

The audit boundary launches the route in a fresh `claude -p` process with the
lifecycle variables scrubbed. Without an explicit tool allowlist that process
cannot run `bash` or `gh`, so the eval floor, the PR classifier, and the slop
metrics are all "unobtainable" and the route fails closed at gate 2 even though
the implementation is green. The failure looks like a stale eval record.

## Detail
**Symptom.** `/audit implementation` returns `AUDIT-FAIL (gate 2: regression
floor — signal unobtainable)` and notes that the same permission boundary blocks
`gh` and the classifier helper. The verdict names a stale `eval-result.json`
commit as the reason, which sends the operator to refresh the record; the refreshed
record fails the same way because the driver still cannot execute anything.

**Root cause.** The shipped example command has no `--allowedTools`, and a
non-interactive session defaults to denying tool use it cannot prompt for. The
route is written as bash gates (`implementation-gates.sh gate1`, the eval runner,
`classify-pr`, `slop-metrics`), so every gate after the file reads depends on
`Bash`. A second trap: the driver appends the prompt as positional arguments, so a
space-separated `--allowedTools Bash Read Glob Grep` consumes the prompt's first
lines as tool names (`Ignoring --allowedTools rule "**Observation**:"`) and the run
fails at startup.

**Workaround.** Pass the allowlist as one token in the command array:
`AUDIT_AGENT_COMMAND_JSON='["claude","-p","--output-format","text","--allowedTools=Bash,Read,Glob,Grep"]'`.
Read-only routes need nothing wider; do not reach for a permissions bypass flag,
which the auto-mode classifier refuses and which grants more than the route uses.
The example in `.oh/skills/audit/SKILL.md` should carry the allowlist so the next
caller does not rediscover this; that edit is a skill change and belongs to a
`/builder` proposal, not to this page.
