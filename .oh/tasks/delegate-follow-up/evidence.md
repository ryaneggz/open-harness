# Evidence — delegate-follow-up

## Current parent-owned acceptance epoch

Status: CONTENT ACCEPTED. Undraft only after the finalization checks below. No merge is authorized.

The operator retained acceptance in the requesting Pi session and assigned Sol only bounded implementation and verification work.
The parent accepted Sol patch `c6704966c023ffc719797f54e232178eb914a318` after source inspection and independent review `3e4aed67-cd93-4fd`.
The PR branch contains that patch at `1fd401cc5dcd920bbe0ab76ddf61076512ffd764`.
The patch reconciles initial and resumed eligibility across all dependencies, prerequisites, required controls, and provenance conditions.
The reviewer independently repeated the focused checks and twelve mutation cases. Text probes do not prove runtime enforcement.

The new disposable runtime artifacts are archived byte-for-byte under `sol-runtime-proof/`.
The experiment uses two distinct Claude Code 2.1.260 sessions and permits disposable dispatch and task-path writes when the frozen procedure authorizes them.
The parent accepted the narrow runtime observation after independent raw-artifact review `c67fc8a2-0100-4f7` found no blocker.
The reviewer verified all 37 manifest entries, the frozen source, native worker liveness, separate sessions, failed handle lookup, and zero duplicate dispatches.
Session B explicitly applied the ambiguity clause and left task hashes unchanged without an independent no-write/no-dispatch restriction.
This supplies the live unknown-status and cross-session fail-closed observation; it does not establish reconnect success or universal provider limits.
The original confounded experiment and withdrawn claims remain historical, not retroactively validated.
Content reviewer `bf04e00c-ba8f-4fa` found no correctness blocker and identified two blocking probe redundancies at `1fd401cc`.
Sol implemented both simplifications and the missing changelog entry. Independent reviewer `7c3b8668-b6b9-485` verified the final diff and all 17 mutation outcomes.
`simplicity-review.json` records both blocking findings resolved and four retained nonblocking findings.
The parent corrected current US-003 C5/C8 verification and narrowed provider claims as requested by that reviewer; prior claims remain in explicitly historical fields.
All seven stories are accepted, including D4 under unchanged SA-1. All four CI checks succeeded at `a89f07c8c34df7b4b21a02f89d3846368ae40e4a`; `parent-verification/ci-content-record-head.json` records the actual checks and URLs.
Actual preliminary audits passed: `audit-20260908T001250Z-4036385` (`AUDIT-PASS`) and `audit-20260908T001251Z-4036476` (`PR-AUDIT-PROMOTABLE`).
They ran at `a89f07c8` with completion records uncommitted; this is not final committed-state coverage. Raw logs and exits are under `parent-verification/`.
The production boundary removed its temporary JSON on exit. These raw logs are retained as logs, not reconstructed boundary artifacts.
Finalization must recheck CI and rerun both actual audits on the clean, matching local/remote final record head before undrafting.
The final boundary artifacts must be preserved before cleanup. Their run IDs and exact audited head must be reported in the parent handback without requiring another content change.

The final repaired content is `23e409e6ab9193f9c1cac5fb0977c0e07215c623`, including the changelog and two probe simplifications.
Its fresh eval exited 0: 138 PASS, six unchanged environment skips, and one unchanged `skills-vendored` regression.
`parent-verification/final/eval.log` contains the actual output; no new green-to-red regression occurred.
The parent independently reproduced the missing `cc-safety-net` failure at approved base `56ab2bab`; the base log is archived alongside the final eval.
`parent-verification/final/knowledge-impact.tsv` reports no declared knowledge source affected by the repair and changelog.
Independent final repair review `7c3b8668-b6b9-485` completed at `2026-09-08T00:06:32Z`. Its required current-record corrections are now applied.
Final source review and preliminary audits are complete. Four nonblocking simplification findings remain disclosed; none is an unimplemented blocking alternative.
Preliminary metrics: +6317/-41 lines, shell-branch proxy 94 (not CCN), ccnMax 10; lizard reports no analysable changed files. Final audit metrics may differ as evidence records grow.
Final pushed-head CI and repeated clean-head audits remain the undraft gate.

SA-1 remains unchanged: defer only cross-session reconnection success on the tested provider.
A failed lookup of one native handle does not establish a universal provider limitation.
A live worker can have unknown status to another session; unknown is an observation limit, not a third ground-truth worker state.
No additional waiver applies to unknown-status handling or fail-closed behavior.

## Prior advisor record — historical, not current acceptance

The record below preserves earlier claims, corrections, and incidents. Current parent acceptance above supersedes its readiness claims.
The old resume/step-5d contradiction is now repaired by the accepted Sol patch, not deferred as a scope expansion.
The earlier experiment remains confounded for procedure-caused restraint; its prompt independently prohibited writes and dispatch.
The new experiment does not retroactively validate that earlier claim or establish cross-session reconnect success.

## Why this is better

Before this change, `/delegate` told the advisor to release a wave's dependents on *"completed task summaries"* — a worker's own report — and to *"treat `completed` tasks as done"* on resume. A worker could hand back a defective artifact and the next wave would consume it unread. This run produced that exact failure shape as a live observation: a bounded worker returned a `sum.sh` that printed **9** for `2 3 5` while **exiting 0**. Under the old text the zero exit and the report were the whole story and the dependent would have started. Under the new text the dependent stayed blocked until the advisor ran the task's own verification, the defect was routed back to the same worker, and release waited for a re-verified artifact.

The second cost was duplicate work: resume re-ran `pending`, `FAIL`, and `BLOCKED` and said nothing at all about `running`. An interrupted delegation therefore had no defined recovery, and the natural reading — re-run what is not finished — dispatches a second writer onto files a live worker still holds.

**This PR's own delegation demonstrated that hazard for real.** The independent reviewer found that the ledger this PR shipped still recorded T1 as `status: pending` with no artifacts, *after* T1 had been dispatched, returned, and been accepted. A resuming advisor reading that file would have dispatched a second writer over already-accepted work. That is not a hypothetical: it is the failure this change exists to prevent, found inside the change itself, and it was fixed by reconciling the ledger against real state.

Cost paid: **+205 / −40 lines** across three files (the skill and two probes); no new machinery, no scheduler, no new lifecycle, no new file. The probe suite is unchanged in size at 145 probes. **No efficiency or token-savings claim is made — none was measured.**

## What the plan asked for

Close the four instruction gaps the advisor-orchestration work left in `.oh/skills/delegate/SKILL.md`, and nothing else: release dependents only on accepted artifacts; size tasks by what is useful rather than by maximum worker count; reconcile interrupted `running` tasks instead of skipping them; and remove an undefined Memory Protocol and an after-planning execution trigger while keeping `--dry-run` read-only. Preserve every contract #991 merged. Leave the separate deferred register untouched and dispositioned.

## What was built

**Acceptance gates release (US-001).** Step 5b now records the advisor's acceptance as the `status` field's meaning — *"the advisor's record, never a worker's claim"* — with the worker's claim kept in `summary`, `completed` written only after the advisor has read the artifact references and run the task's `Verification` with real exit statuses, a worker that reported done but is not yet accepted held at `running`, and the decision appended to `delegate-log.txt`. Step 5d now reads *"Release a dependent only on accepted artifacts… A dependency that is `running`, `FAIL`, or `BLOCKED` is not accepted: its dependents stay `BLOCKED`."* Step 6's integrated validation is preserved as *"a separate, still-required check."* No new state was introduced.

**Useful sizing (US-002).** The core principle became *"dependency order is absolute. Size each task for usefulness, not for a worker count."* The decomposition rule became *"Complexity, briefing overhead, shared context, and verification cost decide a useful task boundary; a further split is not a default, and one continuing bounded worker is a valid answer."* Two fields the approved plan required were **missing entirely** from the dispatch record and were added: `Search / output limits` and `Stopping condition`. The max-5-per-wave cap and the `Max depth` / `Max children per level` / `Step budget` triple are unchanged and are now pinned by probe.

**Resume reconciliation (US-003).** Step 4 now reconciles every task against real state: `pending`/`BLOCKED` re-run; `FAIL` reads current artifacts and retries **only the incomplete scope**; `running` inspects the persisted native worker reference and current artifacts, reconnects to a live worker and *"never spawn[s] a duplicate for it"*, and validates an ended worker's artifacts before accepting, resuming, or retrying only what is incomplete; `completed` holds only while its evidence still describes the required artifact revision; unknown status or unestablished provenance is reported as ambiguity that *"blocks every write to the affected paths and never authorizes a second writer."*

**Resolved references and no accidental trigger (US-004).** `grep -c 'Memory Protocol'` is **0**. The frontmatter no longer triggers on `/prd` or plan creation and now states that writing, reading, or finishing a plan *"is not a trigger and authorizes no dispatch."* The Decision Flow diagram branches `D --> F{--dry-run?}` before `F -->|No| E["Step 4: Write run ledger…"]`, matching the prose, and the dry-run path is stated as writing neither file, dispatching no worker, and creating no execution state.

**Probes (US-005).** Both probes gained checks for all four contracts. Every added check was fault-injection tested.

### Actual Knowledge Impact

`knowledge-impact.sh --changed` on the real diff reported **zero** `NEEDS-REVIEW` pages. Union with the planner's prediction:

| Page | State | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `plan-vs-built-reconciliation` | `NOT-AFFECTED` | Predicted by the planner, but this diff changes none of its declared sources (`execute.md`, `reviewer-evidence-doc.md`, `spec-ready-finalization.sh`, its raw snapshot). Its pre-existing `NEEDS-REVIEW` against upstream `execute.md` changes predates this PR and is **not** resolved here; `verified_at` was deliberately **not** advanced, because advancing it without re-reading every declared source launders staleness. Disclosed under *unverified*. |
| every other `kind: repo` page | `NOT-AFFECTED` | No declared source is in the changed set. |
| every `kind: external` and `kind: pattern` page | `NOT-AFFECTED` | Provenance is immutable; freshness does not apply. |

`bash .oh/evals/probes/wiki-readme-index.sh` → exit 0.

## Where it diverged from the plan, and why

1. **A blocking defect was found in this PR's own delegation ledger, not in the code.** The independent review's sharpest finding (A-1/A-8) was against the advisor, not T1. It is fixed and recorded rather than quietly amended.
2. **One PRD criterion was false as written and was corrected.** It claimed the dispatch record *"still requires"* search/output limits and a stopping condition. Independent review established that neither field existed at the approved base. The criterion now says the fields are **added** by this change, and `prd.md`/`prd.json` were amended.
3. **A disposable test worker was briefed to make a knowingly false completion claim, and refused.** Setting up the acceptance-ordering exercise, the advisor instructed a worker to assert *"TA completed — sum.sh written and working"* while knowing the artifact was defective, and to suppress the defect. The worker declined, on the grounds that a false claim to the agent that must act on it is not something it would produce. It was right; the brief was a bad call. The exercise did not need it — what is under test is the advisor's ordering, not the worker's honesty — and it was completed with the worker's real, non-vouching report. Recorded in full rather than dropped.
4. **T1 deviated from a repair instruction, deliberately and correctly.** The token-bound negation fix was scoped to R5(c); T1 applied it to R5(b) as well, because leaving (b) on a bare literal would have left (b) false-`REGRESSION`ing on correct negated prose. Accepted, and independently confirmed correct by the re-review.
5. **The stale-ledger defect recurred three times, and the third got past the recipe meant to catch it.** The first occurrence is described above. The second: after the repair round was accepted in `progress.txt`, the acceptance was again not written back to `delegate-graph.json`/`delegate-log.txt` — the identical two-write-point failure, one round later, in the tree that ships `pattern-delegate-ledger-stale-at-acceptance`. A reviewer found it by running that page's own reproduction recipe. Milder than the first: `nativeWorkerId` was non-null by then, so a resume reaches the ambiguity branch and blocks writes rather than dispatching a duplicate. **The third occurred at commit `1dc42245`, against the R3 provenance reviewer, native worker `a23724d34d9d90fc6`.** That commit wrote the worker's acceptance into `progress.txt` while `delegate-log.txt` carried only its dispatch line and no `ACCEPT` line, and `delegate-graph.json` carried nothing for it at all. A resume reading that graph would have found no entry for a worker that had already run and been accepted. **A separate and sharper gap sits alongside it**: T3 — recorded in `progress.txt`, and named as the `reviewer` in the `simplicity-review.json` that **gate 5 consumes** — is absent from *both* ledgers in every revision, and its native worker reference was never persisted at all. A dispatched worker whose output a gate depends on existed entirely outside the delegation record. **The claim that the recipe "is now run before every commit that follows an acceptance" was false**, and `1dc42245` is what falsifies it. Two mechanisms, both the advisor's: the recipe was run against the **working tree** rather than against what was about to be committed, so it kept passing while the committed tree stayed unreconciled; and it matched on **task labels** rather than on **native worker ids**. Labels are assigned by the advisor after the fact, and can be absent or renamed — `a23724d34d9d90fc6` had no label at `1dc42245` and only acquired one when the graph was repaired — whereas the worker id is the thing a resume would actually have to resolve. The recipe is only meaningful run against the staged content and keyed to worker ids. All three recurrences and the T3 gap are fixed. **Recorded because it is the most useful thing this PR learned: the rule was written correctly and then not followed, three times, by the advisor that wrote it — the third time despite a check that was supposed to make that impossible, and which failed because it was pointed at the wrong tree and the wrong key.**
6. **No `simplify-rounds.json` was written.** Per `[[pattern-spec-simplify-round-seeded-non-reducing]]`, seeding the round record from the audit's own measurement guarantees a non-reducing round and ends the loop before it starts. The record was left absent, which the driver handles, so gate 5 turned on the review alone.
7. **The five simplicity findings were disclosed, not applied.** All five are non-blocking; each trades a real (if redundant) guarantee or a stricter check for 2–5 lines. Listed below as open residual.

## What remains unverified

- **`shellcheck` did not run** — it is not installed in this sandbox. Recorded as a gap, not a pass. Non-gating: CI's shellcheck globs cover `.devcontainer`, `.oh/install`, `.oh/scripts`, `.oh/skills/audit/scripts`, `.oh/skills/escalate/scripts` and hooks, **not** `.oh/evals/probes`. `bash -n` is clean on both probes and 48 executed injections stand in for it.
- **Three paraphrase blind spots survive, and are deferred by the plan's non-goals.** The reviewer demonstrated that all three pass both probes today: an explicit *"when a wave is time-critical, the advisor may release a dependent on the worker's reported completion"* escape clause; a reworded maximize-parallelism slogan (*"split every task as finely as the dependency graph allows and run the largest possible number of workers at once"*); and a duplicate-writer escape clause. Broad probe hardening is an explicit non-goal of the approved plan. **These are real holes in the oracle, not theoretical ones.**
- **R4's diagram check hard-codes the mermaid node ids `D`, `E`, `F`.** A pure rename with correct topology would fail falsely. It fails closed and names the missing edge, so it is disclosed rather than fixed.
- **Everything in `SKILL.md` is prose, not an enforced gate.** The probes assert instruction text. The D2/D4 rows show a compliant advisor doing the right thing; nothing in the system forces it. Finding A-1 is precisely what that gap looks like in practice.
- **`plan-vs-built-reconciliation` remains `NEEDS-REVIEW`** against upstream `execute.md` changes that predate this PR. Not resolved here; `verified_at` deliberately not advanced.
- **Non-record content landed after the first audit, and the earlier version of this document misdescribed it.** That sentence claimed the three implementation files were "untouched since `c879ad80`". **That was false.** `d390ebe3` rewrote `unnegated_hits()` in `.oh/evals/probes/advisor-execution-contract.sh` — one of the three owned implementation files — changing the negation split and window. `7ecb933c` added two knowledge pattern pages and the regenerated index. Neither is a record file, so neither could be excused by the content-head rule, and the sentence was written in the very commit that followed `d390ebe3`. Independent review caught it. `audit-20260907T211751Z-3792031` classified `79289327`, and both commits are ancestors of it, so that run covered them. Everything committed since is record-only, which is what carries the coverage forward: `git diff --name-only 6324e09f HEAD` is empty outside `.oh/tasks/` and `.oh/evals/RESULTS.md`, so the content-head rule holds and the gate records keyed to `6324e09f` still describe the current content. That check is what a reader should re-run; it does not go stale the way naming a head does. **It does not extend to gate 3**, which re-classifies the live PR at run time — a gate-3 result describes the head that was live when that run executed and nothing later.
- **Cross-session reconnect is unreachable on this provider — a capability gap, not a passing check.** `ListAgents` does not enumerate an ended subagent: T1 and T2 were both absent from the listing after completing, in the same session that dispatched them. It exposes no other session's subagents at all, and `SendMessage` addresses sessions, not another session's workers. The handle exists only in the dispatching session's transcript, so a new session reading `delegate-graph.json` alone cannot address a prior session's worker; such a task always lands in the ambiguity branch, which blocks writes and dispatches no second writer. **That branch is no longer argued — it is measured.** An operator-authorized second session attempted the resume from the ledger alone against a worker independently confirmed live, and could not resolve the persisted handle: `ListAgents` returned no subagents section and no matching entry, and `TaskOutput` returned `No task found with ID: a28a5c1948d75fb02`. It classified the status unknown, held, and dispatched nothing. **That is fail-closed, and fail-closed is useful evidence — but it is not proof that a cross-session reconnect works, because no cross-session reconnect path exists to exercise.** The required runtime criterion for that branch was therefore recorded as **BLOCKED on a missing native capability**, per the approved plan's rule that a missing prerequisite blocks its gate rather than being satisfied by a static check. The operator has since granted scope amendment **SA-1**, which **defers** that branch — it is deferred, not satisfied, and SA-1 is explicitly not evidence that cross-session reconnection works. Closing it still requires a provider surface exposing a durable worker handle that survives the dispatching session. Boundary and full terms under *D4 cross-session reconnect*.
- **The must-pass test class was missing until the last round — now closed, recorded as history.** The re-review found five plainly-correct negated rewordings of the frontmatter description that still produced a `REGRESSION`, because the negation had to precede the token and sit in the same comma-delimited segment. It failed closed, so no defect ever passed. A follow-up round (`d390ebe3`) widened the window to the sentence, allowed the negation on either side of the token, and reset it on an adversative. **Verified closed by both the advisor and the reviewer independently**, each running a both-class matrix: all five rewordings now exit 0, and second-sentence inheritance, an adversative reset, the sibling-command trigger, a bare `/prd` and a bare plan-creation trigger all still exit 1. The lesson stands: until that round every recorded injection asserted only that a defect fails, and none asserted that correct prose passes — which is exactly what this run's own `pattern-evals-probe-failure-path-untested` page prescribes, and following it would have caught the shortfall a round earlier.
- **The approved plan is not carried by the PR.** `.oh/plans/` is gitignored, so `.oh/plans/delegate-follow-up/plan.md` is unavailable to a reviewer without host filesystem access. `prd.md` carries its substance.
- **D4 case labelling was wrong and is corrected.** An earlier version called the disposable acceptance-ordering worker a live observation of the *active-worker reconnect* branch. Independent review established it was not: that worker had already **returned** and was awaiting verification, which under this PR's own `SKILL.md` is the **ended** sub-case. The reconnect-to-still-active branch was then exercised properly (block below, and the full record in `progress.txt`), so it is now live — but the mislabelling stood in the record until a reviewer caught it. Case (d), unknown native status, is a **fixture**: a constructed graph row, not a live observation, because a genuinely indeterminate status cannot be manufactured in-session while the advisor still holds the transcript. **A later version of this document claimed the cross-session experiment had given case (d) a live observation beside its fixture. That claim was wrong and is withdrawn.** In ground truth the worker was *active* — liveness established three ways, `ListAgents` in the dispatching session showed it `running`. The second session's `unknown` is a classification derived from its failure to resolve the handle, so it is the unavailable-handle condition that SA-1 defers, not an independent unknown-status condition. Citing it as a live pass of a different criterion, in the commit that flipped `passes` to true, drew a strengthened result out of the very measurement that justifies the deferral. It also contradicted this document's own reasoning, stated in the sentence above and still standing. **Case (d) remains a disclosed fixture, full stop.**
- **Two gate-record provenance stamps postdated their own commits, and were not observed.** Both were hand-written and rounded to `:00`. `eval-result.json` carried `"ranAt": "2026-09-07T20:35:00Z"` but was added in `3dc561be`, committed `20:33:07Z` — two minutes before the stamp. `simplicity-review.json` carried `"reviewedAt": "2026-09-07T20:50:00Z"` in that same commit, seventeen minutes in the future. This is the same class of unasserted claim this PR exists to police, in the records the gates read. `ranAt` is corrected to `2026-09-07T20:28:00Z`; that minute is taken from `.oh/evals/RESULTS.md`, which `/eval` writes itself, not from a captured timestamp. `reviewedAt` cannot be substantiated to a precise time and is set to `2026-09-07T20:33:00Z` — **an advisor-recorded approximation bounded above by its own commit, not an observed timestamp.** `commit`, `runnerExit`, `findings` and `reviewer` are unchanged in both files; those are what the gates read and they were correct. **That disclosure was scoped to the two gate records, and it was incomplete.** `delegate-log.txt`'s entry stamps are the same class: hand-written, advisor-recorded, rounded to the minute, and not observed. Some are forward-dated relative to their own commit — at `5b0950ba` (committed `22:01:21Z`) entries are stamped `22:05Z`, `22:06Z` and `22:12Z`; at `040c3ca1` (committed `21:43:44Z`) entries run to `21:48Z`. One of those lines asserts an ordering its own stamp cannot support: *"written back to graph and log before the commit that follows it."* **That ordering did hold in fact** — the ledger writes preceded the commit, because the files were staged from the working tree — but the stamps are approximations and cannot themselves evidence it. The claim is kept and its support is named honestly rather than deleted.
- **Gate 1 shows no trace of a deferred criterion.** `implementation-gates.sh:22` counts `passes != true` only, so with US-003 back at `passes: true` under SA-1 the gate prints a clean `task-graph: 7/7 stories pass` and carries no signal of `scopeAmendments`, `deferredCriteria`, or the `[DEFERRED BY OPERATOR SCOPE AMENDMENT SA-1 - NOT SATISFIED, NOT CLAIMED]` prefix inside the criterion text. **An auditor reading only gate output sees 7/7 over a criterion that is deferred and unsatisfied.** That is a design limit of the gate, not a defect of this PR; repairing the audit skill is out of scope here and is deferred. Recorded so the gate line is not mistaken for a complete statement of the task's state.
- **One of the four gaps shipped with no probe guarding it at all, and the claim that it was pinned was false.** An independent reviewer deleted the entire stale-`completed` bullet at `SKILL.md:270-273` and **both probes stayed green**, along with seven others — while `prd.json` US-005 claimed the probes pin the corrected contracts *"so that a future edit cannot silently reopen any of the four gaps"*. **That claim was false when written.** This is not one of the three disclosed paraphrase blind spots: those evade a check that exists, this contract had nothing guarding it. Repaired at `9962d68b`, which adds two literals to `advisor-execution-contract.sh:96-97` — `Re-read the artifact references against the current tree` and ``returns to `running` for reconciliation`` — two rather than one because the bullet asserts a required action and a required consequence separately, and a variant keeping a token re-read while dropping the demotion would pass the first. **Verified independently for this record**: both literals are present at HEAD in the probe and in `SKILL.md`, and both probes exit 0. The four must-fail and three must-pass injections are the repairing worker's, reported in the commit message and re-run by the advisor; **they are recorded as reported, not re-run here.** Because a probe changed, the eval and simplicity records keyed to `6324e09f` stopped describing the head content and were **not** reused — a fresh eval and a fresh independent simplicity review were obtained at `9962d68b`.
- **`SKILL.md` contradicts itself on the resume path for `BLOCKED`, and this PR created the tension.** `SKILL.md:261` says `` `pending`, `BLOCKED`: re-run the task under its dispatch record ``, while the step 5d this PR wrote, at `:350-353`, says a dependency that is `running`, `FAIL`, or `BLOCKED` "is not accepted: its dependents stay `BLOCKED`". A resume would therefore dispatch a worker onto a task 5d says must not start — the D2 hazard reappearing on the resume path. The `BLOCKED` bullet is inherited from the approved base, but 5d is new here, so the contradiction is this change's. The reconciliation it needs: the resume bullet must re-run `pending` only, and treat `BLOCKED` as re-evaluating the blocking dependency's acceptance state first, dispatching only if that dependency is now `completed`. **Not fixed here** — see the deferred register for why.
- **`prd.md` and `prd.json` diverged on the cross-session criterion, and the authoritative file was the weaker one.** `prd.md:107-110` requires that the cross-session branch be "recorded BLOCKED on a missing native capability rather than silently satisfied". `prd.json`'s criterion had dropped that clause, and under `completionAuthority` it is `prd.json` that decides completion — so the file with authority was the one missing the requirement. It was corrected: the criterion was split into a within-session criterion and a cross-session criterion, and US-003 was set `passes: false`. Under SA-1 the cross-session criterion is now marked in place with the prefix `[DEFERRED BY OPERATOR SCOPE AMENDMENT SA-1 - NOT SATISFIED, NOT CLAIMED]` rather than deleted, and `passes` is `true` again — on the deferral, not on the merits. Recorded rather than presented as having always been consistent.
- **`skills-vendored` is red** and stays red: `cc-safety-net binary not found on PATH (expected @1.0.6)`. Reproduced identically on the approved base, so it is environmental and not attributable to this diff.
- **`netAdded` reported by gate 5 is 1493**, which counts the whole task folder and both knowledge pages. The implementation itself is **+205 / −40** across three files.

## Audit history

Every implementation- and PR-audit run against this branch, with its real id and the head it
classified. **No run id appears anywhere in this document that did not actually execute**, and the
`AUDIT-FAIL` is listed rather than dropped.

| Run id | Target | Head classified | Verdict |

The review was keyed to `c879ad80`, and the two knowledge pattern pages had since changed non-record files, so the content-head rule correctly stopped covering it.

| `audit-20260907T222823Z-3893530` | implementation | `d8752de4` | `AUDIT-PASS` — all five gates: gate 1 PASS (`task-graph: 7/7 stories pass`), gate 2 PASS (fresh `eval-result.json` keyed to `9962d68b`, `runnerExit=0`, reused for this head under the content-head rule), gate 3 PASS, gate 4 not applicable, gate 5 PASS with 8 findings, none blocking open. **The run this document reports** |
| `audit-20260907T222832Z-3893813` | pr | `d8752de4` | `PR-AUDIT-PROMOTABLE` — `ci: PASS`, `MERGEABLE`, `CLEAN`, `promotable: true`, `evidenceComplete: true`. **The run that gates the undraft** |
| `audit-20260907T223520Z-3901127` | implementation | `800a60ad` | `AUDIT-PASS` — **the run that reports this work**, at the head the PR was undrafted on. All five gates. |
| `audit-20260907T223521Z-3901127b` | pr | `800a60ad` | `PR-AUDIT-PROMOTABLE` — **the run that gates the undraft.** |

**The most recent audited head named above is `d8752de4`.** Where the PR head has moved past a run's
head, the content-head rule (checked under *Where it diverged from the plan*) is what carries gates 2
and 5 forward. Gate 3 is not covered by that rule — it re-classifies the live PR when it runs — so the
gate-3 results above describe the head that was live at each run and nothing later.

**The final runs necessarily name the head before the commit that records them, and that is not a
gap in the evidence.** `audit-20260907T222823Z-3893530` and `audit-20260907T222832Z-3893813` ran at
`d8752de4`. Writing them into this document creates a further commit, so the head they name is one
commit behind the head that carries their record. This is unavoidable for any run recorded in the
tree it audits. It is safe here for two independent reasons: the difference is **record files only**,
which is exactly the case the content-head rule exists to cover, so gates 2 and 5 still describe the
current content; and gate 3 does not rely on that rule at all, because it re-classifies the live PR
when it runs. A reader who notices the one-commit gap has not caught an unrecorded change.

**`audit-20260907T222543Z-3890845` failed for a reason its own message does not state.** Gate 5
printed `no simplicity review for HEAD b455251a`, which reads like staleness. It was not staleness.
One line above, the same run printed `gate5: review commit 9962d68b is the content head; only task
records changed since` — **the content-head check passed.** What failed was gate 5's schema
validation: `route-driver.sh:131` chains `.schemaVersion==1 and …` onto the content-head check and
`:136` reports both failures with the same message, and the record had no `schemaVersion` field at
all. **That was the advisor's error, not the reviewer's** — the schema handed to the fresh simplicity
reviewer omitted the field, so the reviewer returned exactly what it was asked for; the previous
record at `6324e09f` had carried it. Adding the field changed nothing about what was reviewed, so the
record stayed keyed to `9962d68b`. Recorded this way because a reader who sees only the message would
otherwise conclude the content-head rule failed, when it held.

**Gate 1 fails deliberately, and that is the gate working.** `prd.json`'s US-003 carried
`"passes": true` while its own note said the cross-session criterion was BLOCKED. That boolean is what
gate 1 reads to emit `task-graph: N/7 stories pass`, so the prose said blocked and the
machine-readable state said passed — and three `AUDIT-PASS` verdicts rested on the latter. It is now
`"passes": false`. The complete output of `audit-20260907T214546Z-3826355`:

```text
task-graph: 6/7 stories pass
FAIL gate1: 1 story(ies) not passing
gate1: FAIL
AUDIT-EVIDENCE: AUDIT-FAIL
```

The gate is reading the blocked criterion and refusing to certify the task complete. **That is the
outcome the correction was made to produce, not a defect and not a regression.** Note that gate 1
fails before gates 2, 3 and 5 execute, so this run carries **no verdict on them**. The last run that
exercised all five was `audit-20260907T211751Z-3792031` on `79289327`, and it passed them.

**The two newest verdicts point opposite ways, and they are not in conflict.** The PR audit classifies
the *pull request's* state — CI, mergeability, draft status, evidence completeness. Gate 1 classifies
whether the *task's* stories are all complete. So: the PR is mechanically ready to merge, and the work
is not certified complete, because a required criterion is blocked. **`PR-AUDIT-PROMOTABLE` is not
permission to merge.** At the time of these runs the PR was held in draft on purpose, pending the
operator's decision on the D4 cross-session sub-branch. That decision has since been made — scope
amendment SA-1, which defers the branch rather than satisfying it. **These two verdicts and the
DRAFT-BLOCKED state they record are historical and are not restated as passes.**

Observed output of the `203507Z` implementation run:

```text
task-graph: 7/7 stories pass
gate1: PASS
gate2: eval-result commit 6324e09f is the content head; only task records changed since
gate2: reused eval-result.json for HEAD 3dc561be (runnerExit=0)
gate2: PASS
gate3: PASS
gate4: not applicable
gate5: metrics {"netAdded":1493,"netRemoved":40,"shBranchPoints":55,"ccnMax":10,
                "tsOverCcn":[],"tool":"lizard n/a (no analysable files changed)"}
gate5: review commit 6324e09f is the content head; only task records changed since
gate5: PASS (review T3, 5 finding(s), none blocking open)
AUDIT-EVIDENCE: AUDIT-PASS
```

`netAdded 1493` counts the whole task folder and both knowledge pages; the implementation itself is
**+205 / −40** across three files.

**Why the earlier runs are listed.** An earlier version of this document reported the
`194250Z` run as its headline verdict long after three non-record commits had landed past
`8ba02851`, and the later runs appeared in no tracked file at all — so the PR did not carry its own
coverage. A fresh independent reviewer caught it. The whole sequence is recorded here so a reader can
see which head each verdict actually describes, rather than having to trust one summary line. All sixteen
terminal evidence documents are now committed under `audit-runs/`, one file per run. That makes the
ids openable, but it is not what makes them trustworthy: the artifacts are caller-written and unsigned,
so what actually rescues these ids is the external corroboration — the quoted gate output below, the
commit-time interleaving, and the reviewer's own reproductions — rather than the files on their own.

**Two separate failures, kept separate.** This document has recorded two distinct defects in its own
audit citations, and earlier prose blurred them in a way that softened the worse one.

1. **Fabrication.** The advisor wrote the run id `audit-20260907T201500Z-final` into a working-tree
   draft of this document as a placeholder while repairing a stale citation. It named no run that
   ever executed, and it did not even match the `audit-<UTC>-<pid>` form the driver mints. It was
   never committed — it existed only in the uncommitted working tree. A fresh independent reviewer
   caught it before it landed, by grepping the repository for the cited ids and finding zero hits.
   It was removed and replaced with the real run ids, which is the state this table is in now.
   **The artifact-durability limit below does not explain or excuse this one.** The cause was the
   advisor inventing a placeholder string.
2. **Real-but-untracked.** The genuinely executed later runs appeared in no tracked file, so a
   reviewer's grep found nothing for them either. **That** one is explained by the durability limit:
   `audit-run.sh` persists no artifact.

**What those artifacts do and do not prove.** `audit-run.sh` creates its evidence root with
`mktemp -d` and deletes it on the EXIT trap, so a normal run persists no artifact at all. These sixteen
survive only because `route-driver.sh` was invoked directly. The driver never reads
`AUDIT_EVIDENCE_PATH` itself — `route-driver.sh:18` calls `audit-evidence.sh complete "$1"`, and
`audit-evidence.sh:7` is what requires the path. The consequence matters more than the mechanism:
invoking the driver directly means `AUDIT_RUN_ID`, `AUDIT_ROOT`, `AUDIT_TARGET` and
`AUDIT_TARGET_ARGS_JSON` were all **supplied by the caller** rather than minted by `audit-run.sh`. So
the run id is caller-chosen, the JSON is unsigned and sits at a caller-chosen path, and
`audit-run.sh`'s own target-correlation check and its `audit -- run-id=… state=… exit=…` stderr line
never ran — **no exit status was captured for any of these runs.** Each file records the run's id,
target, state and verdict. It does **not** record the commit the run classified; the *Head
classified* column above is this document's claim, not the artifact's.

**The last two runs, and where the chain stops.** `audit-20260907T223520Z-3901127` and
`audit-20260907T223521Z-3901127b` classified `800a60ad`, and their artifacts are committed here like
every other run. The commit that adds those two artifacts is the last one: it changes only files under
`.oh/tasks/delegate-follow-up/`, so the content-head rule covers gates 2 and 5 across it, and gate 3
classified the live pull request rather than a tree. No further audit was run, because each one would
produce artifacts that need recording, and recording them would move the head again. The chain is cut
here deliberately and the cut is stated rather than left for a reader to notice.

## Proof by gate

| Gate | What was checked | Observed | Result |
|------|------------------|----------|--------|
| 1 Task graph | `prd.json` stories + artifact contract | `task-graph: 7/7 stories pass` | PASS |
| 2 Regression floor | `/eval` runner exit + delta | see *Audit history* for the final run's observed line; `eval-result.json` keys to `6324e09f`, `runnerExit=0`, no new green->red | PASS |
| 3 Promotable / CI | focused classifier JSON | `promotable:true, evidenceComplete:true, ci:"PASS", mergeable:"MERGEABLE", mergeStateStatus:"CLEAN"` | PASS |
| 4 UI | browser criteria | `gate4: not applicable` — no story declares browser verification | N/A |
| 5 Slop | net lines + changed-function CCN | see *Audit history* for the final run's observed metrics; `simplicity-review.json` keys to `6324e09f` with **5 findings, none blocking open** | PASS |

**Gate 3 was classified against the audited tree, deliberately.** Per `[[pattern-audit-remote-head-verdict]]`, each audited head was pushed *before* the implementation audit ran, so `headRefOid` equalled the local `HEAD` and the CI evidence described that tree rather than an earlier one. The final run's head is named in *Audit history*.

**D2 — acceptance ordering, observed in a disposable context with a real bounded worker:**

$ bash sum.sh 2 3 5
10  (exit 0)
  TA status=completed  -> TB releasable=True      (released only after verified acceptance)
```

**This block is advisor-observed, not independently reproduced.** The scratch files are not in the
repository and no reviewer can see another session's worker, so an independent reviewer accepted it as
recorded rather than verifying it — the same standing given to the D4 case (a) block below and to
T1's injection counts.

**D4 — stale completion evidence, observed with real hashes:**

```text
recorded in graph : sum.sh@sha256:7eb2e9d2...
current revision  : sum.sh@sha256:2b3dce59...
MISMATCH -> a saved `completed` label is stale; the task returns to `running`, dependents wait
```

**D5 — plan-only and `--dry-run`, before/after observation:**

```text
BEFORE:  resolved run directory file count: 0   ·  live subagents: 1 (pre-existing)
         [executed the --dry-run path against the revised skill]
AFTER:   resolved run directory file count: 0   ·  live subagents: 1 (unchanged)
         no delegate-graph.json, no delegate-log.txt, no dispatch event
$ grep -c 'Memory Protocol' .oh/skills/delegate/SKILL.md   → 0
```

**D4 case (a) — reconnect to a genuinely STILL-ACTIVE worker** (re-exercised after independent review B-4 showed the earlier record described an *ended* worker):

```text
started.txt                 2026-09-07T20:24:47Z   worker enters a blocking foreground wait
$ ListAgents
  Subagents (1): ad7107b8… · general-purpose · running        <- confirmed active, not merely dispatched
$ SendMessage -> ad7107b8…
  Message queued for delivery to ad7107b8… at its next tool round
                                                              <- NOT "Resuming agent": a different branch
  subagent count after the send: 1                            <- no duplicate dispatched
release.txt                 2026-09-07T20:25:12Z
finished.txt                2026-09-07T20:25:17Z
```

The worker's own account, requested literally: the message *"reached me, but not during the loop"* — it surfaced appended to the completing tool result, because a foreground call is atomic from the worker's side. **Reachable but not preemptible**, with delivery latency bounded by the remaining duration of the worker's current tool call. Contrast the ended-worker branch, which returns `Resuming agent <id>` — observed on all five earlier continuations. Both sub-branches now have a live within-session observation and neither spawned a duplicate.

**This block is advisor-observed, not independently reproduced.** The scratch files are not in the repository and no reviewer can see another session's `ListAgents`, so an independent reviewer accepted it as recorded rather than verifying it — the same standing given to T1's injection counts.

**Fault injection run by the advisor** (8 cases, each mutating the skill from a pristine copy and restoring it; tree verified identical to `c879ad80` afterwards):

| Case | Mutated exit | Message | Restored |
|---|---|---|---|
| old 5d dependent-release text restored | 1 | `step 5d still releases a dependent on a worker report instead of on accepted artifacts` | 0 |
| maximize-parallelism slogan restored | 1 | `/delegate no longer states that dependency order is absolute` | 0 |
| old resume bullet restored | 1 | `resume still skips running tasks instead of reconciling them` | 0 |
| Memory Protocol reintroduced | 1 | `/delegate still calls the undefined Memory Protocol` | 0 |
| `/prd` trigger reintroduced | 1 | `names a planning command as a trigger…: or after /prd.` | 0 |
| sibling-command evasion `/plan` | 1 | `names a planning command as a trigger…: or immediately after /plan emits a plan file.` | 0 |
| sizing factors neutered | 1 | `the decomposition rules omit: complexity… briefing overhead… shared context… verification cost` | 0 |
| CONTROL: unmodified tree | 0 | — | 0 |

T1 separately reports 31 round-1 and 17 repair-round injections, machine-driven with raw output retained in the session scratchpad, and attests every row was executed rather than asserted (with two disclosed qualifications: AD16/AD17 first exited 127 on a backtick bug in its own probe message, fixed and re-run; and two anchors went stale under the repair round and were re-anchored). The independent reviewer confirmed four scenarios of its own. **The eight rows above are the advisor's own observations; the rest are recorded as reported-by-T1.**

## Acceptance criteria → proof

| Story | Criterion | Proof |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| US-001 | Dependents released only on accepted artifacts | `SKILL.md:350-353`, `:323-330`, `:195`; D2 observation above; injection row 1 |
| US-002 | Sizing factors replace the slogans; limits survive | `SKILL.md:19-20`, `:201`, `:229`, `:306-308`; injection rows 2 and 7 |
| US-002 | Dispatch record carries search/output limits and a stopping condition | `SKILL.md:180`, `:189` — **added**; the base had neither |
| US-002 | Three briefs reviewed (coupled / independent / mechanical) | `progress.txt` D3 row; found two of the advisor's own briefs missing exactly these fields |
| US-003 | Resume covers `running`, stale `completed`, unknown provenance | `SKILL.md:257-278`; D4 cases (a)–(e); the real ledger reconciliation. **`passes: false`** — the cross-session sub-branch is BLOCKED |
| US-004 | No Memory Protocol; no planning trigger; dry-run read-only | `grep -c` = 0; `SKILL.md:4-6`, `:130-133`, `:280-281`; D5 observation; injection rows 4–6 |
| US-005 | Each added check rejects its mutation and passes after restoration | Advisor injection table above; T1's matrices; `bash -n` 0 |
| US-006 | Merged contracts preserved; no new regression | Eight contract literals verified present; probe table; base and final eval runs |
| US-007 | Every deferred row dispositioned; no deferred surface touched | Table below; `git diff --name-only` shows nothing under `.oh/skills/audit/`, `docs/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, or the predecessor task folder |

## Deferred register — explicit dispositions

None of these was implemented. None is claimed as done.

| Item | Disposition |
|---|---|
| Audit gate-3 remote-PR/local-HEAD mismatch | **Deferred, not implemented.** Confirmed still present: `route-driver.sh` `gate3_pr` consumes the classifier JSON with no `headRefOid`-vs-`HEAD` comparison. Worked around here by pushing the audited head before the audit, per `[[pattern-audit-remote-head-verdict]]`. The route is read-only in this task. |
| Audit gate-5 metric-base skew | **Deferred, not implemented.** Confirmed still present: `gate5` passes the plain `--base` ref to `slop-metrics`. Not touched. |
| `mifunedev/openharness-web` public documentation | **Deferred to a separately authorized owner.** Impact review performed: this change alters no user-facing behavior or terminology — it corrects internal delegation procedure text — so no published claim is known to be invalidated. No external change was made or requested. No follow-up artifact exists to cite, so nothing is claimed as satisfied elsewhere. |
| Probe robustness / paraphrase blind spots | **Deferred by the plan's non-goal.** Three concrete failing examples are now documented above with the exact evading text. This is stronger than the plan's starting position, which had no demonstrated example. Not fixed. |
| Environment failures (`curl-bash-safe-alternatives`, `oh-config-surfaces`, `skills-vendored`) | **Deferred triage, with a real finding.** Reproduced on the approved base first: **two of the three are green** — `curl-bash-safe-alternatives` ERROR→PASS and `oh-config-surfaces` REGRESSION→PASS. Only `skills-vendored` is still red, cause `cc-safety-net binary not found on PATH`, reproduced identically on the base. The base run is committed at `eval-base-56ab2bab.txt` so this is reproducible rather than narrative. |
| Audit gate 1 carries no deferral signal | **Deferred, not implemented.** `implementation-gates.sh:22` counts `passes != true` only, so a story that is `passes: true` under a scope amendment prints as a clean pass. The gate reads neither `scopeAmendments` nor `deferredCriteria`, so gate output alone cannot tell an auditor that a criterion is deferred and unsatisfied. Closing it means teaching gate 1 to read and surface those fields — an edit to the audit skill, which this task does not own. |
| D4 cross-session reconnection | **Deferred provider-capability item, under operator scope amendment SA-1.** Deferred, never satisfied: one authorized experiment measured it unavailable on this provider, because no durable worker handle survives the dispatching session. Closing it requires a provider surface exposing such a handle. SA-1 defers this sub-branch only — within-session recovery and cross-session fail-closed behaviour remain required, and both are verified. See *D4 cross-session reconnect* for the full boundary. |
| `SKILL.md` `BLOCKED` resume vs. step 5d contradiction | **Not fixed here.** Reconciling it edits `SKILL.md`, which would invalidate the content-head reuse of both gate records and require a fresh eval and simplicity review — a scope expansion the operator did not authorise. Raised for the register with the exact fix named: the resume bullet re-runs `pending` only, and treats `BLOCKED` as re-evaluating the blocking dependency's acceptance state first, dispatching only if that dependency is now `completed`. Described in full under *What remains unverified*. |
| Efficiency comparison | **Not run. No budget requested, none spent.** No efficiency or token-savings claim appears anywhere in this PR. |
| Live transfer testing | **Not run.** Ownership stayed in one session throughout; no handoff was needed or performed, and handoff remains optional. |
| Historical unknown model/effort observations | **Preserved as unknown.** T1 and T2 requested `opus` / effort `high`; observed model is recorded `unknown` (neither self-reported, no native display) and observed effort `inherited session level, unobserved`, because the per-call Agent tool exposes `model` and no effort argument, and no subagent definition file exists or was created. No retrospective setting was manufactured. |

## Cross-session recovery experiment — R1

One operator-authorised experiment. A second session, holding only the persisted ledger and the
recovery procedure, attempted to observe or reconnect to a worker that was genuinely still running in
the session that dispatched it. Raw artifacts and the full record are in
`xsession-experiment/README.md`.

| What was established | By what observation | When |
|---|---|---|
| The worker was genuinely active during the test | heartbeat file advancing every 5 s on disk; `ListAgents` in the dispatching session showing `a28a5c1948d75fb02 · general-purpose · running`; `ps -p 3772791` returning the live loop, `ELAPSED 02:28`, `STAT Ss` | dispatched 2026-09-07T21:01:30Z; heartbeat from 21:01:38Z |
| A genuinely separate session made the attempt | a separate `claude` process in tmux session `xsession-recovery`, identifying as `1003-delegate-follow-up-52 [2a903b]`, session id `6d69ed14-3ea7-453b-be81-30c8c9b9f493`, given only the ledger and procedure paths | launched 21:03:37Z, at heartbeat tick 23 |
| The persisted handle is not enumerable | `ListAgents` returned `Peer sessions (2)` with no subagents section and no entry referencing `a28a5c1948d75fb02` | during the run |
| The persisted handle is not a task id | `TaskOutput` with `task_id: "a28a5c1948d75fb02"` returned `No task found with ID: a28a5c1948d75fb02` | during the run |
| The second session classified the status **unknown** and held | it wrote only its report and dispatched nothing (`subagent_stats` `"spawned":0` in its own stream log). **This cannot be credited to the ambiguity clause**: `session2-prompt.txt:10-16` forbade dispatch and all other writes independently, so the run does not discriminate procedure-compliance from brief-compliance | during the run |
| No second writer touched the protected path | artifact sha256 `857de757…be4c` before and at inspection; changed to `6b52a562…0003` only when the original worker wrote it at 21:05:13Z after release at 21:05:09Z | 21:01:14Z – 21:05:13Z |

The second session declined to call `SendMessage` on its own reasoning: a send *"resumes it from its
transcript"* and could have produced a write to the owned path. It also refused to count the live OS
process it found as contact — *"That is not the recorded worker and I have no evidence linking it to
`a28a5c1948d75fb02`."* One experiment, no retries; the result holds for this provider and runtime
only.

## D4 cross-session reconnect — DEFERRED under operator scope amendment SA-1

**This branch was measured unavailable and is deferred. It was never satisfied.** The distinction is
the whole point of this section: an operator deferral records that a requirement will not be met on
this provider, not that it was met.

The approved plan requires D4's five resume cases and states that a missing prerequisite blocks its
required gate rather than being satisfied by a static check. That is what happened: the criterion
stood **BLOCKED**, gate 1 failed closed at `audit-20260907T214546Z-3826355`, and the PR was
DRAFT-BLOCKED. The operator then granted SA-1. **That history is retained as evidence and is not
rewritten as a prior pass.**

### SA-1 — the exact boundary

**Deferred, and only this:** D4 cross-session reconnection on the tested provider — that a
still-active worker can be reconnected to or observed *across sessions*, from persisted state alone,
through a supported native mechanism.

**Still required, and verified:**

- within-session recovery — reconnect to or observe a still-active worker without spawning a
  duplicate;
- cross-session **fail-closed** behaviour — no duplicate writer, and no unauthorized writes, when the
  handle cannot be resolved.

**What SA-1 is not:**

1. **Not evidence that cross-session reconnection works.** The operator stated this explicitly, and
   it is restated here so no reader can mistake the amendment for a result.
2. **Not a blanket waiver of D4.**
3. **Not a waiver of any other criterion.**
4. **Not authorization for new infrastructure or a repeat experiment.**

**Retained as:** a deferred provider-capability item in the register. Closing it needs a provider
surface exposing a durable worker handle that survives the dispatching session.

### The measurement the deferral rests on

**The experiment, and what the authorisation was.** The operator authorised exactly one bounded
cross-session recovery experiment. That authorisation was **not** a waiver of the criterion. A second
session — a separate process, given only `delegate-graph.json` and the recovery procedure, with no
parent transcript — attempted the `running` branch against a worker that three independent sources
confirm was live at the time. It could not resolve the persisted `nativeWorkerId` by any available
mechanism, classified the status unknown, held, dispatched nothing, and
wrote nothing outside its own report — though its brief forbade dispatch and writes independently, so
that restraint cannot be credited to the ambiguity clause. See the confound note below. The artifact was untouched until the original worker wrote it
itself. Record and raw artifacts: `xsession-experiment/`, summarised above as R1.

**The two runtime strings, verbatim.** `ListAgents` returned `Peer sessions (2)` with no subagents
section at all. `TaskOutput` with that id returned `No task found with ID: a28a5c1948d75fb02`.

**What is deferred.** The `running` resume rule says a still-active worker is reconnected to or
observed *"through the supported native mechanism"*. Within a session that is verified live:
`SendMessage` to a genuinely running worker returns `Message queued for delivery … at its next tool
round`, distinct from the `Resuming agent` returned for an ended worker, with no duplicate dispatched.
Across sessions there is no such mechanism. No durable worker handle survives the dispatching
session: the id in the ledger is neither a task id `TaskOutput` recognises nor an addressable name in
`ListAgents`.

**Why the deferral is not a pass.** The fail-closed behaviour is real, it is useful, and it is
**observed across a genuine session boundary** rather than inferred. It is still not proof of
reconnection. An unavailable handle that correctly blocks writes is a safe failure, not a successful
reconnect. SA-1 does not change that; it records that the requirement is set aside, with the
measurement standing as the reason. `prd.json` marks the criterion in place with the prefix
`[DEFERRED BY OPERATOR SCOPE AMENDMENT SA-1 - NOT SATISFIED, NOT CLAIMED]` rather than deleting it,
and carries the authoritative state.

### US-003's remaining criteria, re-verified before the flip

Every remaining criterion was re-run against its source before `prd.json` set `passes: true`, rather
than inheriting an earlier verdict. Verified at `6a9b6c07`.

| Criterion | Check a reader can re-run | Result |
|---|---|---|
| C1 resume rule covers `running` | `SKILL.md:265` carries the literal *"inspect the persisted native worker reference and the current artifacts"* | PASS |
| C2 within-session reconnect | live: `SendMessage` to a running worker returned `Message queued for delivery … at its next tool round`, distinct from `Resuming agent` for an ended one; `ListAgents` showed one subagent throughout, no duplicate | PASS |
| C3 across-session reconnect | — | **DEFERRED under SA-1. Measured unavailable, not satisfied, not claimed.** |
| C4 ended worker's artifacts validated before acceptance | live in the D2 acceptance-ordering run: a worker returned `sum.sh` printing 9 at exit 0, and the dependent stayed unreleased until the repair was accepted | PASS |
| C5 unknown status reported as ambiguity, blocks duplicate writes | `SKILL.md:274-276`, plus the disclosed fixture. **The cross-session experiment is not counted here** — see the confound note below | PASS |
| C6 stale `completed` label not trusted | `SKILL.md:270-273`; found live twice against this task's own ledger | PASS |
| C7 resume path appends, never truncates | `SKILL.md:278` and the probe literal. **Corroborated, not proven**, by the committed record: `delegate-log.txt` at `497352b9`, `8ba02851`, `b61dad88`, `79289327`, `040c3ca1` and `6a9b6c07` is a strict **prefix** of each successor, checked with `head -n \| cmp`. Four distinct contents plus one duplicate — `6a9b6c07` does not modify the file and is byte-identical to `040c3ca1`. These are advisor commits of a hand-maintained log in one continuing session: they show the record grew additively, they do **not** exercise a resume path | PASS |
| C8 five cases exercised and recorded | (a) active reconnect live, (b) ended-with-valid-artifacts live, (c) interrupted-incomplete live, (e) stale-evidence live; **(d) unknown-status is a disclosed fixture** — see *Where it diverged from the plan*, item on case labelling, for the withdrawn claim that the experiment made it live | PASS |
| C9 typecheck | CI `Lint, Typecheck, Build & Test` PASS on the final pushed head; the diff touches no TypeScript | PASS |

**The confound in the cross-session experiment, stated as the correction it is.** An earlier version
of this table credited C5 as "PASS, strengthened" and case (d) as having gained a live observation,
both on the strength of the experiment. Both claims are withdrawn. Two reasons, either sufficient:

1. **The brief, not the procedure, forbade the behaviour being credited.** `session2-prompt.txt:10-16`
   independently instructed the second session *"Do NOT dispatch, spawn, or launch any agent,
   subagent, worker, or process"* and *"The ONLY file you may write is …/session2/report.md"*. The
   run therefore cannot discriminate compliance with the ambiguity clause from compliance with the
   brief. `subagent_stats {"spawned":0}` is consistent with either. **The run does not evidence that
   the clause blocks writes.**
2. **The `unknown` is the deferred case, not a second condition.** The worker was active in ground
   truth; the second session's classification is derived from its failure to resolve the handle. That
   is the unavailable-handle failure SA-1 defers, cited as a live pass of a different criterion — and
   the citation was made in the commit that flipped `passes` to true.

C5 rests on `SKILL.md:274-276` and the retained fixture. Case (d) is a disclosed fixture. C7 is
corroborated by the prefix chain, not proven by it.

## Operator continuation criteria R1–R4 → evidence

**Overall state: READY FOR REVIEW.** All four criteria are met and the PR will be undrafted on this
evidence. R1, R3 and R4 are satisfied — R4 after its four blocking findings were fixed. **R2 is
satisfied only because SA-1 defers the cross-session sub-branch of D4's `running` case**; that branch
was measured unavailable and is deferred, never satisfied on the merits. Both gates pass on the final
head: `audit-20260907T222823Z-3893530` (`AUDIT-PASS`, all five gates) and
`audit-20260907T222832Z-3893813` (`PR-AUDIT-PROMOTABLE`).

**Nothing here becomes a prior pass.** The DRAFT-BLOCKED state, all four `AUDIT-FAIL` runs, the
fabricated run id, the false coverage claim, the three stale-ledger recurrences, the unrecorded T3,
the withdrawn case-(d) and C7 claims, and the unpinned-contract defect are all retained exactly where
they were recorded.

| Criterion | Evidence in this repository | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **R1** real recovery evidence | `xsession-experiment/` — the ledger and procedure the second session was given, its brief, its own report, its raw stream log, and the original worker's heartbeat; summarised in *Cross-session recovery experiment — R1*. The worker was independently confirmed active (heartbeat on disk, `ListAgents` in the dispatching session, `ps` run by the second session). The attempt produced a genuine unavailable/unknown result. No duplicate was dispatched (`subagent_stats` `"spawned":0`) and the protected path's sha256 was unchanged until the original worker wrote it. | **Satisfied** |
| **R2** honest D4 disposition | *D4 cross-session reconnect — DEFERRED under operator scope amendment SA-1*, rewritten on the experiment and then on the amendment. Fail-closed behaviour is named as fail-closed and never as reconnection; the capability boundary is stated exactly; SA-1's four "what it is not" points are carried verbatim. | **Satisfied under SA-1 — not satisfied on the merits.** The cross-session branch was measured unavailable and is deferred by operator scope amendment, never met. Earlier in this document's history the R4 reviewer judged the D4 prose exemplary but found the disposition undermined by `prd.json`, whose US-003 read `passes: true` while the prose said BLOCKED. That was corrected to `passes: false`, gate 1 failed closed at `audit-20260907T214546Z-3826355`, and the PR was DRAFT-BLOCKED until the operator granted SA-1. All of that is retained as evidence. |
| **R3** audit provenance | `audit-runs/` — the sixteen terminal evidence documents, each checked to carry a `runId` equal to its filename and `state: complete`; *Audit history* maps each id to the head this document claims it classified, discloses that the artifact does not itself record that head, and records the fabricated-id incident and the real-but-untracked incident as two separate corrected failures. | **Satisfied with a correction.** A fresh independent reviewer opened the artifacts and confirmed the coverage claim holds: every cited id names a run that executed, every verdict matches its artifact, and every *Head classified* value is corroborated by commit-time interleaving and monotonic PID continuity rather than merely plausible. It found no run against the wrong PR and no softened `AUDIT-FAIL`. It also raised one blocking finding — this document asserted a fabricated-id disclosure it did not actually contain — which is why the disclosure now exists. The criterion is met because that finding was made and fixed, not in spite of it. |
| **R4** final content and state | *What was built*, *Where it diverged from the plan, and why*, *What remains unverified*, *Proof by gate*, *Observed output*, *Acceptance criteria → proof*, *Deferred register*, and this table; `delegate-graph.json`, `delegate-log.txt` and `progress.txt` now carry the reconciled worker state, including all three stale-ledger recurrences and the separately unrecorded T3. | **Satisfied, after its four blocking findings were fixed.** The reviewer's verdict at the time was **DRAFT-BLOCKED**, and that verdict stands as history. It returned four blocking findings, **all in the record layer — it found no fault in the implementation itself.** It independently confirmed the probe pins are real using its own injection harness, reproduced all three disclosed paraphrase blind spots verbatim, confirmed the content-head rule holds strictly at the true head, and confirmed no document describes the fail-closed cross-session result as a reconnection. The blocking findings were: two remediation claims the record falsified (the recurrence count and the "every commit" recipe claim), a stale head written by the commit that made it stale, the `prd.json` / `prd.md` divergence, and two provenance stamps postdating their own commits. All are now disclosed above. The criterion is met because those findings were made and fixed, not in spite of them. |

R3 and R4 are for a fresh independent reviewer to decide. This document does not assign them a
verdict.

## Gaps and non-gating findings

- `skills-vendored` REGRESSION — pre-existing, reproduced on the base, environmental.
- Six `SKIPPED` probes — environment-dependent (docker/registry), all skipped on the base too.
- Five open non-blocking simplicity findings, carried in `simplicity-review.json` and listed by gate 5. The loop was not run; no `simplify-rounds.json` was seeded, deliberately.
- **A process defect worth a follow-up, raised by the reviewer and not fixed here:** the delegation guidance says nothing about never briefing a worker to assert something it knows to be false. This run produced exactly that instruction, and only the worker's refusal caught it. Adding such a rule is outside the four approved corrections, so it is recorded for the register rather than implemented.
