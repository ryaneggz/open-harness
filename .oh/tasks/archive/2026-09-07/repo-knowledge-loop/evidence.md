## 0. Why this is better than not doing it

**Before.** `/spec` wrote durable knowledge more reliably than it read it. Nothing
in the planning contract required a session to recall what the repository already
knew, so each plan re-derived it — and re-derived it differently. The planner's
`Wiki Alignment` block was the *only* knowledge-impact oracle, even though
implementation reaches paths a planner never sees. Page validity was decided by
`updated > 90d`, which is unrelated to whether the page is still true. Knowledge
pages were gitignored-by-default and whitelisted one at a time, so one machine
could consume a page that a fresh clone could not see. And several `/spec`
surfaces carried a second copy of state that already existed elsewhere.

**After, with the numbers this run produced.**

| | Before | After | Observed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Knowledge read before a plan exists | not in the contract | required step 2, recorded in `## Knowledge Context` | `spec-plan-knowledge-context.sh` |
| Knowledge-impact oracle | the planner's prediction | prediction **∪** actual diff **∪** declared dependencies | `spec-execute-knowledge-impact.sh`; this build's own run below |
| Pages this build would have missed on the old oracle | — | **2 of 6** (`document-ingestion`, `oh-cli-portable-lifecycle` were never predicted) | the gate run below |
| Validity test | `updated > 90d` | a declared source changed after `verified_at` | `knowledge-source-freshness.sh` |
| Unresolvable provenance found by the new check | unmeasured — no check existed | **5** (3 phantom snapshots, 2 bad pins), all repaired | the source-path check |
| Places completion is represented | 2 (`prd.json` + a prose sentinel) | 1 (`prd.json`) | `task-completion-structured-state.sh` |
| Writable knowledge locations | 1, gitignored-by-default | 1, tracked, with scratch physically separate | `knowledge-path-single-owner.sh`, `knowledge-tracked-query-boundary.sh` |
| `/spec` conceptual nodes | 4 (`ship` owned no mechanics) | 2 + a wrapper | `spec-family-contract.sh` |
| `/wiki lint` checks | 6, all report-only, 0 with an oracle | 6, **6 with a named oracle**; 2 unenforceable ones retired | `lint.md:23-33` |
| Execution states a caller can observe | 0 (a detached launch reported a ready PR) | 4, in `/tmp/agent-spec-<slug>.state` | `spec-execute-running-contract.sh` |

**The sharpest number is 2 of 6.** The Actual Knowledge Impact gate found six
pages this change touched. `prd.md`'s `Expected Knowledge Impact` — written by the
planner with the whole issue in front of it — named four of them and missed
`document-ingestion` and `oh-cli-portable-lifecycle`. Under the old model those
two would have shipped stale, silently. That is the loop closing on its first run.

**Cost paid.** 106 files, +3873/−1931. The `/spec` reference docs grew
(`SKILL.md` 138→235, `plan.md` 142→251, `execute.md` 603→742) because three real
gates were added; `lint.md` shrank 551→427 and `ship.md` (121 lines) was deleted.
The probe suite grew 117→127. One new executable, 179 lines
(`knowledge-impact.sh`), replaces logic that would otherwise have been duplicated
in `/wiki lint` and `/spec execute`.

**Claimed, unmeasured:** that recall makes *future* plans better. This run proves
the mechanism exists and fires; a capability-benchmark delta over several cycles
would be the measurement, and it does not exist yet.

## 1. What the plan asked for

Issue #926 asked for one thing in eighteen parts: make `/spec` a closed loop in
which accumulated repository understanding is consumed before work, re-verified
against current reality, spent, and replenished — and retire the surfaces that
had grown a second copy of state.

In the operator's terms:

1. Planning must **read** durable knowledge before it writes a PRD, and must
   re-check what it read against the repository rather than trusting it.
2. An approved plan that grounding materially changes must **stop**, not proceed.
3. The **diff**, not the planner, must decide what the change made untrue.
4. Freshness must be a fact about sources, not about the calendar.
5. Durable knowledge must own its own surface, and shared knowledge must be
   physically separate from per-machine scratch.
6. `ship`, generated `prompt.md`, `STATUS: COMPLETE`, mandatory `/compact`, and
   the `.oh/memory` vocabulary must go — **atomically**, with every consumer.
7. Detached execution must have a real `RUNNING` state.
8. The single-Advisor executor model must survive all of it (pinned comment).

---

## 2. What was built

### The knowledge surface (US-001, US-002, US-003)

```
$ git log --diff-filter=R --name-status --format= origin/development..HEAD | grep -c '^R'
32
$ git ls-files -- .oh/skills/wiki | sed 's|.oh/skills/wiki/||'
SKILL.md
references/compile.md          references/official-docs-research-wiki.md
references/concurrent-ingest-worktrees.md   references/query.md
references/github-repo-research-wiki.md     references/schema.md
references/ingest.md           references/social-image-wiki-ingest.md
references/lint.md             scripts/knowledge-impact.sh
   (11 files — procedure only; not one data page remains under the skill)
$ bash .oh/evals/probes/knowledge-path-single-owner.sh
PASS: one writable knowledge surface at .oh/knowledge/ — the retired corpus path is gone
from disk, from git, and from every active reference, and the new surface ships and gates in CI
```

The ledger moved without being edited. Its old path is resolved from the base
tree rather than spelled out, because the guard above scans this document too:

```
$ BASE_LEDGER=$(git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/development | grep '/skill-impact\.md$')
$ diff <(git show "origin/development:$BASE_LEDGER") .oh/evals/decisions/skill-impact.md \
    && echo IDENTICAL
IDENTICAL
```

Scratch is physically separate and no read path touches it:

```
$ bash .oh/evals/probes/knowledge-tracked-query-boundary.sh
PASS: .oh/knowledge/local/ is ignored, holds nothing tracked but its anchor, is enumerated
by no read path, and has an explicit promotion path
```

### Source-change freshness (US-002)

`knowledge-impact.sh` is the single implementation. Its `--verified` mode is what
`/wiki lint` calls; the numbers below are real state, not a fixture:

```
$ bash .oh/skills/wiki/scripts/knowledge-impact.sh --verified | cut -f1 | sort | uniq -c
     11 NOT-APPLICABLE
      5 FRESH
      4 NEEDS-REVIEW
```

The four `NEEDS-REVIEW` rows — `audit-architecture`, `fresh-machine-setup`,
`managed-agents`, `release-versioning` — are pre-existing debt the old age rule
could not see: each names a `kind: repo` page whose declared sources moved after
its `verified_at` commit. Under `updated > 90d`, every one of them was "fresh".
The pages this change itself updated are absent from the list, because resolving
them advanced their pins — which is the check working, not the check being
silenced.

### The Actual Knowledge Impact gate (US-005) — run for real on this build

```
$ git diff --name-only origin/development...HEAD | wc -l
105
$ bash .oh/skills/wiki/scripts/knowledge-impact.sh --changed $(...105 paths...) \
    | grep NEEDS-REVIEW
NEEDS-REVIEW  document-ingestion            declared sources are in the changed set: .oh/skills/wiki/references/ingest.md
NEEDS-REVIEW  oh-cli-portable-lifecycle     declared sources are in the changed set: .oh/manifest.json .oh/README.md docs/oh-directory-layout.md docs/rfcs/rfc-brain-hands-boundary.md
NEEDS-REVIEW  plan-vs-built-reconciliation  declared sources are in the changed set: .oh/skills/spec/references/execute.md
```

Union with `prd.md`'s `Expected Knowledge Impact`, and the state each page ended in:

| Page | State | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `plan-vs-built-reconciliation` | **UPDATED** | every `execute.md` line and step anchor it cites moved; records the knowledge gate now beside the evidence gate |
| `oh-cli-portable-lifecycle` | **UPDATED** | the manifest it documents now ships `knowledge/**` |
| `wikiskill-experience-compilation` | **UPDATED** | its "the harness lacks the pattern layer, the impact ledger, and any wiki read on the proposer path" is now wrong on all three counts |
| `pattern-wiki-ungated-check-drift` | **UPDATED** | corroborating evidence appended per schema § 11a; this change applied its prescribed workaround to the whole check list |
| `pattern-wiki-external-model-over-mapping` | **UPDATED** | corroborating evidence appended; two exclusions written down alongside the structures that transferred |
| `plan-vs-built-reconciliation` | **UPDATED again after the merge** | `execute.md` moved a second time when #930 landed; all nine line anchors re-verified against the merged file and `verified_at` advanced |
| `oh-cli-portable-lifecycle` | **UPDATED again after the second merge** | #931 removed `agents/**` from the manifest and the two agent provider links from `init.ts`; the page's manifest paragraph records both and `verified_at` advanced |
| `document-ingestion` | **REVERIFIED** | `ingest.md` moved under it, but only paths and kind guidance changed; its conversion claims still hold. `verified_at` advanced, body untouched |
| `audit-architecture` | **NOT-AFFECTED** (no declared source is in the changed set; the audit subsystem is untouched by this change) | named in the prediction, not in the diff |

### The `/spec` contract (US-004, US-005, US-006)

```
$ for p in spec-plan-knowledge-context spec-plan-reconciliation-gate \
           spec-execute-knowledge-impact spec-execute-running-contract \
           spec-no-generated-prompt-contract task-completion-structured-state \
           retired-memory-vocabulary spec-family-contract advisor-monitored-loop \
           spec-ready-finalization; do
    printf '%-34s ' "$p"; bash .oh/evals/probes/$p.sh 2>&1 >/dev/null | head -1
  done
spec-plan-knowledge-context        PASS: /spec plan recalls tracked knowledge and re-grounds it before the PRD, and records Knowledge Context
spec-plan-reconciliation-gate      PASS: a materially changed approved intent stops for re-approval and cannot flow into /spec execute
spec-execute-knowledge-impact      PASS: /spec execute derives knowledge impact from the actual diff through the shared primitive and resolves every page to one explicit state
spec-execute-running-contract      PASS: detached execution reports RUNNING against a real status file and never promises a synchronous READY
spec-no-generated-prompt-contract  PASS: the durable task contract is prd.md + prd.json + progress.txt; the launch prompt is rendered, never persisted
task-completion-structured-state   PASS: task completion derives from prd.json structured state; the prose sentinel survives only in marked historical records
retired-memory-vocabulary          PASS: the retired memory tier appears in no current architecture doc, and its ignore rule is a labelled tombstone with a removal horizon
spec-family-contract               PASS: /spec owns the workflow, dispatches plan/execute/retro with an approved plan path as the default, ...
advisor-monitored-loop             PASS: one /spec Advisor owns implementation and gates; /delegate is bounded fan-out; retired handoff is absent
spec-ready-finalization            PASS: /spec execute treats the draft PR as a checkpoint, refuses the undraft without a tracked evidence.md, ...
```

The last two matter most for the pinned execution requirement: the lifecycle
change did **not** cost the single-Advisor model or the human merge boundary.

### This run dogfooded the contract it built

`prd.md` carries `## Knowledge Context` (base commit, queries, 8 slugs read,
grounded-against list, 4 conflicts), `## Expected Knowledge Impact`, and
`## Plan Reconciliation`. The task folder is three files plus `evidence.md` and
`eval-result.json` — no `prompt.md`. Completion is `prd.json`:

```
$ jq -e 'all(.userStories[]; .passes == true)' .oh/tasks/repo-knowledge-loop/prd.json && echo COMPLETE
COMPLETE
```

The status file was kept current at every phase, which is how the orchestrator
observed `RUNNING` rather than inferring it. The shipped contract names it
`/tmp/spec-<slug>.state` after the #930 reconciliation; this run also kept writing
the pre-reconciliation path its orchestrator was already polling, so the observer
never lost the signal mid-build.

### The re-ground step fired on this build, against this build

Step 0 of the new `execute.md` exists for exactly one situation, and it happened:

```
$ git log --oneline ecc49800..origin/development
0f87d985 FROM task/928-retire-spec-agent-handoff TO development (#930)
$ git diff --name-only ecc49800..origin/development | grep -c '^.oh/skills/spec/'
5
```

`development` moved onto five of the files this change rewrites, retiring the
execution mechanism #926's own pinned comment names. The merge surfaced nine
conflicts; each was resolved toward the merged repository state, and the five
probes #930 added — `spec-no-agent-handoff`, `spec-single-owner`,
`spec-no-advisor-session-coupling`, `cleanup-no-agent-session-coupling`,
`headless-tmux-preserved` — all pass alongside this change's ten:

```
$ bash .oh/skills/eval/run.sh
ran 131 probe(s)   →   exit 0, zero green→red, 4 SKIPPED (same 4 as base)
```

This is the loop's own thesis demonstrated on itself: a plan written against
`ecc49800` was re-grounded against a base that had moved underneath it, and the
divergence was reconciled explicitly rather than discovered at merge time.

### The regression floor

```
$ bash .oh/skills/eval/run.sh
ran 127 probe(s); wrote .oh/evals/RESULTS.md
   (runner exit 0; zero green->red transitions; 4 SKIPPED — the same 4 as base ecc49800)
$ bash .oh/scripts/link-providers.sh --check
Providers OK: .pi/.claude/.codex skills -> .oh/skills (vendored pack present)
$ git diff --check && echo clean
clean
```

## 3. Fault injection — every new probe's REGRESSION branch was driven

A probe that has never failed has an unverified oracle
(`[[pattern-evals-unexercised-oracle]]`). Each injection below was applied,
observed, and reverted; each probe was re-run after revert and returned to PASS.

| Probe | Injection | Observed |
|---|---|---|
| `spec-plan-knowledge-context` | delete the `## Knowledge Context` block line | `REGRESSION: plan.md no longer specifies the block: ## Knowledge Context` |
| | reorder so grounding follows `/prd` | `REGRESSION: plan.md orders the pipeline wrong — recall and grounding must precede /prd` |
| | re-add a `## Wiki Alignment` heading | `REGRESSION: the retired Wiki Alignment planning block reappeared as a section heading` |
| `spec-plan-reconciliation-gate` | downgrade the stop to a warning | `REGRESSION: plan.md's reconciliation gate does not stop before execution` |
| | delete the `## Plan Reconciliation` block line | `REGRESSION: plan.md no longer specifies the ## Plan Reconciliation block` |
| `spec-execute-knowledge-impact` | rename the gate heading | `REGRESSION: execute.md has no Actual Knowledge Impact gate` |
| `knowledge-tracked-query-boundary` | comment out the `local/` ignore rule | `REGRESSION: .oh/knowledge/local/ is not gitignored — a scratch page would enter the shared set` |
| `knowledge-source-freshness` | make `dep_matches` always return false | `REGRESSION: changing a declared dependency did not mark the page needs-review (got: 'none')` |
| | point a pin at a path absent from a present commit | `REGRESSION: pinned source does not resolve at ce7b7db2 (basename hits: 0)` |
| | point a pin at an unreachable commit | `PASS ... (1 pin(s) unverifiable in this clone depth)` — deliberately not a failure |
| `spec-execute-running-contract` | remove the status file | `REGRESSION: execute.md defines no status file, so RUNNING is not observable` |
| `spec-no-generated-prompt-contract` | reintroduce a generated task prompt | `REGRESSION: .oh/skills/spec/references/plan.md still names a task-folder prompt artifact` |
| `task-completion-structured-state` | re-add the sentinel to the cleanup cron | `REGRESSION: active surface still keys on the retired completion sentinel: crons/cleanup-tasks.md:170` |
| `retired-memory-vocabulary` | list `memory/` in the `.oh/` contents table | `REGRESSION: .oh/README.md still lists memory/ in its contents table` |
| `knowledge-path-single-owner` | create a file under the retired path | `REGRESSION: the retired corpus directory still exists on disk` |

**The single-owner guard fired on this document.** The first draft of § 2 quoted
the retired path inside two shell transcripts, and `/audit implementation` gate 2
returned `AUDIT-FAIL` naming `evidence.md:86` and `:96` — a textbook instance of
`[[pattern-docs-prohibition-by-example]]`, arriving in the one file written to
prove the migration was complete. The fix followed that pattern's own workaround:
name the guard and resolve the path programmatically rather than restating it. The
oracle was **not** widened to exempt `evidence.md`, because an exemption for the
document that describes the migration is exactly the hole through which the
retired path comes back.

**The undraft ordering fault was found by review, and fixed in the contract.**
`gh pr ready` ran at `d1aebc75` with its four checks green, but two commits
followed and one was pushed while CI was still running — so the PR sat *ready* on
a classification that no longer described its head. Every pushed head has since
completed all four checks green (`d1aebc75`, `b0ee168a`, `b2b83e29`, `9e54a9dd`,
`a6c2f1ed`), so the outcome held; the ordering did not.

The procedure allowed it: `execute.md` said the promotable audit runs
"immediately before any undraft" and said nothing about a push *after* one.
Step 10 now (a) confirms the PR's `headRefOid` equals local HEAD before reading
the classification, (b) states that the gate re-opens on every push after the
undraft and that a no-longer-promotable head goes back to draft via
`gh pr ready --undo`, and (c) says the cheap way to honor this is to finish the
tail before undrafting at all. `spec-ready-finalization.sh` gained three
assertions over that section; all three were fault-injected and fire
(`REGRESSION: /spec execute does not confirm the PR head is the commit it is
promoting`, `... no longer re-opens the promotable gate on a post-undraft push`,
`... names no way back to draft when a pushed head stops being promotable`).

**A stray `2` file was committed, and deleting it was not the fix.** A `sed`
invocation had rewritten `>&2` to `&>2` inside
`spec-execute-running-contract.sh`, and `&>2` is valid shell that redirects into
**a file named `2`** rather than to stderr. So the probe re-created the file on
every suite run: the first deletion was undone by the next `/eval`. The fix is at
the source — the redirect is `>&2` again — and
`eval-contract-text-20260831.sh` now fails any probe containing `&>[0-9]`, with
the reason spelled out, so the class cannot return silently:

```
$ sed -i 's|synchronous READY" >&2|synchronous READY" \&>2|' <probe>   # inject
$ bash .oh/evals/probes/eval-contract-text-20260831.sh
REGRESSION: spec-execute-running-contract.sh: '&>N' redirects to a FILE named N,
not to a descriptor — use '>&N'
```

Same class as the `pipefail` finding this run compiled: a shell redirect that
silently did something other than what it read as, and that a green suite could
not see.

**The simplify gate deleted a mode nobody called.** `/audit implementation`
gate 5 found `knowledge-impact.sh --since <ref>` with zero call sites, contradicting
the script's own stated contract of two consumers. The Advisor deleted the branch
rather than arguing for it (round 1 of 3): 179 → 172 lines, and `--since` is now
rejected with the usage line. `--verified` and `--changed` are unchanged and still
exercised by `knowledge-source-freshness.sh` and `spec-execute-knowledge-impact.sh`.

**Fault injection changed the work, which is the point.** The first pass on
`spec-plan-knowledge-context` reported PASS *after the block it guards was
deleted*: a heading naming `` `## Knowledge Context` `` satisfied a substring pin.
Both planning probes were rewritten to assert the block by exact line
(commit `786920fd`). Two probes that looked green were not.

---

## 4. Where they diverged from the plan, and why

1. **`depends_on:` was collapsed into `sources:`.** Requirement E illustrates
   freshness with a separate `depends_on:` list ("for example"); requirement F
   normatively puts repository paths in `sources:`. Two lists of the same paths
   is the duplication `AGENTS.md` forbids. `sources:` is the single declaration
   and `verified_at:` pins the check. The behavior E asks for is unchanged.
   Declared in `prd.md` before implementation.
2. **`/spec retro` took option 1 of requirement K** (compatibility wrapper), not
   option 2 (delete). `references/retro.md` is a `protected-paths.txt` entry and
   an `audit-stale-references.sh` coverage path; deleting it needs a
   protected-path removal #926 does not ask for. The wrapper carries no second
   ontology — `spec-family-contract.sh` now fails if it grows one.
3. **No `/spec ship` alias survives.** Zero callers repository-wide outside the
   skill's own two files, so the non-goal against compatibility abstractions
   applies. A two-line redirect for a literal `ship` first token remains, for a
   correctness reason rather than a compatibility one: without it,
   `/spec ship <plan>` would derive the slug `ship`.
4. **`.oh/knowledge/raw/` is tracked, not ignored.** This PRD's US-001 criterion 4
   as first written required `raw/` to be ignored. It holds the immutable
   snapshots `kind: external` pages cite, and an untracked snapshot is provenance
   a fresh clone cannot verify — problem 4 of the issue, wearing a new name. The
   criterion was corrected mid-build; the issue's own layout comment annotates
   only `local/` as ignored, so this moves toward the issue, not away. Recorded
   in `prd.json`'s US-001 `notes` and in `prd.md`'s Plan Reconciliation.
5. **A fourth provenance form was added: a bare upstream URL.** Not in the issue.
   Forced by real state: three pages (`managed-agents`,
   `molt-agentic-reinforcement-learning`, `recursive-self-improvement-survey`)
   cited `raw/` snapshots that exist in **no commit** — the new source-path check
   found them. Repaired without fabricating provenance: two carry the arXiv URL
   their own bodies state; `managed-agents`, whose upstream URL is recorded
   nowhere in the repository, is reclassified `kind: repo` against the five
   repository documents it actually reasons over, with its unrecoverable external
   seed stated in the page. The URL form is documented as the weakest, and
   `/wiki ingest` can never produce it.
6. **Two pattern pins were re-pointed.** `pattern-wiki-ungated-check-drift` and
   `pattern-wiki-external-model-over-mapping` cited knowledge pages at
   pre-migration shas, where the new path does not exist. Re-pinned to a revision
   where the cited path is real. Historical precision is slightly reduced; the
   alternative was writing the retired path into a tracked file, which the
   single-owner guard forbids.
7. **`/eval` ran three times, not once.** Run 1 found a self-inflicted regression
   (`wiki-compile-contract` pinned schema sections I renumbered). Run 2 was clean.
   Run 3 followed the shallow-clone fix below. The once-per-cycle rule exists to
   stop three runs against the *same* commit telling us the same thing once; each
   of these ran against a different commit after a real change.
8. **`.oh/tasks/compose-env-boundary/prompt.md` was deleted.** A tracked artifact
   of the retired contract in another task's folder. Retiring the artifact from
   the durable contract while leaving a tracked instance behind would not be
   atomic.

9. **The execution base moved mid-build, and the reconciliation is the one call a
   reviewer may want to overrule.** PR #930 (issue #928) merged into
   `development` while this build was in its tail and retired the `/spec`
   agent-handoff mechanism: no tmux launch, no `/goal` prompt, no
   `agent-spec-<slug>` session naming, and `RUNNING` redefined as *task* state
   rather than a process. #926's pinned comment asks for the opposite in
   mechanism — "one persistent Herdr/tmux-backed session", `RUNNING` as "the
   persistent Advisor doing the work". This build **adopted the merged state**,
   because it is the newer operator decision and because it preserves every
   invariant that comment actually protects: one implementation owner,
   `/delegate` bounded beneath it, the
   `PLANNED → RUNNING → READY | DRAFT-BLOCKED(<gate>)` lifecycle, and human merge
   as the final boundary. What changed is *who* the owner is — the agent already
   running `/spec execute`, not a session it spawns — and the status file name
   (`/tmp/spec-<slug>.state`). Flagged on the PR so the operator rules on it.

10. **`cleanup-no-agent-session-coupling.sh` was amended, not just satisfied.**
    #930's probe pinned `STATUS: COMPLETE` as the archival key while its actual
    subject is session decoupling — and #926 retires that sentinel. The probe now
    asserts the same decoupling against `prd.json` structured state. Both
    contracts hold; neither was weakened.

11. **`development` moved a second time, and PR #931 landed too.** It made skills
    the only role primitive, retired the `agents/**` payload and the agent
    provider links, and added `/architect` plus five probes. Two follow-on edits
    were required and made: "Advisor" is now a retired role identity, so
    `plan.md` and the `/retro --task` section say *owner*; and `roles-are-skills.sh`
    carried two exclusions for the retired corpus path, which after this change
    protect nothing while re-introducing the retired literal into a tracked file
    and tripping `knowledge-path-single-owner`. Both exclusions were removed
    rather than the guard being widened.

12. **`development` moved a third time: PR #934 retired cron worktree
    isolation.** `execute.md`'s build-worktree step branched on `$CRON_WORKTREE`;
    it now branches on the checked-out branch, matching the merged contract. Three
    merges landed on this branch during the tail, on five, thirty-eight and eleven
    files respectively. Each was reconciled explicitly rather than discovered at
    merge time — which is the behavior step 0 of the contract this change ships
    exists to produce.

---

## 5. What remains unverified

- **`shellcheck` was not run locally** — it is not installed in this worktree, so
  US-002's "passes shellcheck" clause was not observed here. CI's *Boot Path Lint
  (shellcheck + hadolint)* job covers it and is green on this branch.
- **Four pages are `NEEDS-REVIEW` against their own `verified_at`** —
  `audit-architecture`, `fresh-machine-setup`, `managed-agents`,
  `release-versioning`. This is pre-existing debt the new check made visible for
  the first time, not something this change caused: no declared source of any of
  the four is in this diff. Clearing it means re-reading four pages against
  sources that moved over months, which is a separate unit of work. `/wiki lint`
  reports it; nothing blocks on it. `managed-agents` is on the list *because* this
  change reclassified it `kind: repo` against real repository sources — before
  that it cited a snapshot that exists in no commit and could not be checked at
  all.
- **Two probes SKIP in CI**, `wiki-pattern-persistence` and
  `wiki-skill-impact-append-only`, because a depth-1 checkout has no merge-base.
  They SKIP identically on the scaffold commit `dc8043da`, before any of this
  change existed, so the behavior is pre-existing. Both PASS locally against a
  full clone, and both were made rename-aware in this change so the migration
  itself did not silence them.
- **One pin is unverifiable at CI clone depth** by design (see the fault-injection
  table). The check reports the count rather than failing; a reviewer who wants
  full-history verification runs the probe against a full clone.
- **`kind: external` and `kind: pattern` freshness is not modelled.** Their
  provenance is immutable, so no source-change test applies. A paper that is
  superseded upstream is invisible to every check here; that is a deliberate
  scope boundary, not an oversight.
- **The `/spec plan` recall step is a procedure, not an executable.** The probes
  assert that the contract requires recall and ordering; they cannot assert that a
  future session actually performed it. The `## Knowledge Context` block is the
  artifact a reviewer checks.
- **Claimed, unmeasured:** that recalling knowledge improves plan quality over
  time. The mechanism is proven to exist and to fire; the capability-benchmark
  delta that would measure the payoff needs several cycles.
- **`eval-result.json` can never satisfy its own freshness key.** The record
  stores the commit it ran against, and committing the record moves `HEAD` past
  it, so a downstream reader following the `commit == HEAD` rule always re-runs.
  `/audit implementation` did exactly that on this build and was right to. The
  reuse contract predates this change and is out of its scope; recorded here and
  nominated as a retro hypothesis rather than patched in passing.
- **The diff grew 384 lines after the last simplify round, and the loop ended on
  the monotone rule rather than on the diff getting smaller.** The post-merge
  audit flagged this, correctly. The growth is attributable, not unexamined work:
  of the 733 lines added since the round-1 commit, **537 arrived with the
  `development` merge** — PR #930's four new probes and the `/spec`, `/delegate`,
  `/rlm`, `/ste`, `/t3`, `/audit`, capability, cron and docs surfaces it rewrote —
  plus this run's two compiled pattern pages. Two further merges (#931, #934)
  landed after that measurement. Round 2 found **no blocking
  finding** and `SIMPLICITY-RESIDUAL: 0`; the two residuals round 1 disclosed were
  re-examined and cleared (`--format slugs` has real call sites in two probes, and
  extracting the probes' one-line `ROOT=` preamble would add a file rather than
  remove lines). The round record carries the attribution so a reviewer does not
  have to reconstruct it.
- **The PR carries the advisory `size-convention` flag** — 113 files after the merge, past the
  50-changed-file convention. It is not splittable without breaking the thing the
  issue asks for: requirement H says every moved-path consumer, doc, probe,
  script, provider wiring, and CI filter is updated **atomically**, and a
  migration landed in two PRs leaves a window with two writable knowledge
  locations, which is the acceptance criterion's explicit failure case. Flagged,
  not fixed, so the reviewer decides with the reason in front of them.
- **Public-documentation mirror to `mifunedev/openharness-web`** — the repo half is
  done here (`docs/oh-directory-layout.md`, `docs/glossary.md`, the RFCs,
  `.oh/README.md`, `.oh/tasks/README.md`); the site half is filed as
  **[mifunedev/openharness-web#37](https://github.com/mifunedev/openharness-web/issues/37)**,
  which is what the issue's last acceptance criterion asks for. The criterion is
  therefore **met**, not deferred: it requires a separate follow-up issue, not a
  site change in this PR.

  Two published pages carry live drift, both found by grepping the site rather
  than assumed:
  - `docs/harnesses/deepagents.md:154,156,164,180` — describes `/spec execute` as
    owning implementation "in one Advisor session" and "the Advisor-owned task
    session". Both the role name and the session-ownership model are retired.
  - `blog/2026-07-07-open-harness-demo-guide.md:131` — lists `.oh/memory/` as
    "session logs and durable lessons", i.e. as current architecture.

  Checked and deliberately **excluded**: `docs/integrations/pi-autoresearch.md:65`
  cites `.auto/prompt.md`, which is Pi autoresearch's own file and unrelated to the
  retired `.oh/tasks/<slug>/prompt.md`. The four repo docs this PR changes are not
  published on the site, so they carry no mirror obligation. The site has no page
  describing the knowledge surface at all, which is a coverage gap rather than a
  contradiction and is recorded in #37 as optional.

## 6. What this run compounded back

Both probes the session-scoped retro nominated are **minted**, and each was
fault-injected on every branch before being counted green:

| Probe | Guards | Injection observed |
|---|---|---|
| `evals-20260901-suite-tree-clean` | no probe redirects into the repository (`&>N`, or a redirect targeting `$ROOT`/`$HARNESS`), and no redirect residue is tracked at the root | all three branches fired: the `&>2` spelling, a `> "$ROOT/..."` write, and a tracked root file named `2` |
| `docs-20260901-followup-artifact-cited` | the evidence contract requires a follow-up to be cited, and every tracked `evidence.md` bullet tying a criterion to a follow-up carries a resolvable issue/PR URL | reconstructing **this run's own defect** — replacing the openharness-web#37 link with the words "a separate follow-up issue" — fires it |

The second is the sharper of the two: it fails on the exact text this build
shipped before verification caught it, which is the only real test of a probe
minted from a retro.

Two design choices are worth the reviewer's eye. `evals-20260901-suite-tree-clean`
is a **static** guard plus a residue check, not a sandboxed execution test: a
probe cannot run the suite to observe what the suite writes without recursing
into itself. A first draft flagged any redirect to a relative path and produced
46 findings — shell comparisons (`(( n > CAP ))`), prose arrows, and heredocs
written inside a probe's own `mktemp` directory — so it was narrowed to patterns
that cannot mean anything else. `$AUDIT_ROOT` is deliberately not anchored: it is
invocation-scoped by contract and probes legitimately point it at a fixture.

The `&>[0-9]` check added to `eval-contract-text-20260831.sh` mid-session was
**moved** into the new probe rather than duplicated. One rule, one owner: the
literal-pinning probe guards pinning, and write hygiene now has its own.


`/retro --task repo-knowledge-loop` tested 9 hypotheses (8 supported, 1
inconclusive) and `/wiki compile` turned the durable ones into knowledge:

| Page | Action | Lesson |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern-evals-pipefail-early-exit` | **created** | under `pipefail`, a reader that exits on first match SIGPIPEs the writer, so a successful match reports as a failed pipeline |
| `pattern-spec-self-staling-reuse-record` | **created** | a commit-keyed record committed into the repository it measures can never satisfy `commit == HEAD`, so the fallback is the only path |
| `pattern-evals-prose-literal-pinning` | patched | the same matcher fails the other way too: a short pin can be satisfied by a heading that merely names the block it guards |
| `pattern-docs-prohibition-by-example` | patched | the guard fired on this document; resolve a retired path programmatically, and never exempt the file that describes the migration |

Two probe candidates were **nominated and not minted**: a `pipefail`/`grep -q`
lint over shell scripts (12 files repo-wide carry the shape) and a doc-lint on the
reuse-record contract. Both are guardrails worth having and neither is asked for
by #926; minting them here would widen a diff gate 5 already flagged for size.
The knowledge pages above carry the workarounds, so the lessons are durable
whether or not the probes land.

Context compaction was **not run**. It is optional and non-gating in the new
contract, and every durable artifact above was written at full resolution first,
which is the ordering the change exists to guarantee.

## 7. Benchmark verdict

`/benchmark` — **`BENEFICIAL` (justified hold)**.

- **Floor**: the record was stale against HEAD, so the suite was re-run rather
  than inherited: 127 probes, exit 0, zero new `green→red`, four SKIPPED that are
  the same four skipped on base.
- **Ceiling**: suite score **held at 1.44/2.00** against the counterfactual. That
  is a *justified* hold rather than "machinery without movement", because the
  disqualifier for the latter is no capability task crediting the change — and
  CB-005 credits it directly: its success signal asks for a tracked pattern page
  with a `path:line` root cause and pinned `<path>@<short-sha>` provenance, and
  this run produced two and patched two more.
- **`REDIRECT-FLAG` raised.** The suite has **no task that measures
  recall-before-plan**, which is the capability this change adds, so the ceiling
  cannot see it in either direction. This is the shape CB-004 was retired for — a
  row that held at `Δ +0.00` because nothing was ever measured. Recommended
  redirect: author a CB task scoring whether a plan consumed tracked knowledge
  before its PRD existed.
- **No ledger write.** `/benchmark` writes an `SI-nnnn-V` record only for a
  `/builder` proposal under evaluation; none covers #926.
- Instrument grooming (`/audit eval-quality`) was not run — that follow-on does
  not exist yet, and is named rather than silently skipped.
