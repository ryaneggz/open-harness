# source: issue #988 / ADR #989
# desc: prose check of the advisor-first execution contract in /spec execute, its task prompt, and
#       the /spec skill: bounded workers implement before the owner accepts, a direct owner edit
#       needs a recorded operator exception, the task stays in the same session by default,
#       transfer happens only on operator request with the originating advisor stopping dispatch
#       and the receiver acknowledging ownership, a plan without a handoff prompt is valid, the
#       advisor has no fixed identity, /spec launches no coding-agent process, a worker's completed
#       status is a report rather than acceptance, and the human merge gate stays. Extended by
#       issue #1003 for /delegate: acceptance is recorded before a dependent is released, resume
#       reconciles `running` tasks and stale completion evidence, every procedure reference
#       resolves (no Memory Protocol), planning alone is not a trigger, and the diagram branches
#       on --dry-run before the run-ledger write (asserted as graph edges, not text order).
#       Issue #1004 requires blocked and pending tasks to satisfy every dependency, prerequisite,
#       control, and provenance condition before dispatch. This probe inspects instruction text;
#       it does not verify runtime delegation, recovery, eligibility decisions, or model settings.
