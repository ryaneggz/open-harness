# source: issue #988 / ADR #989 (advisor-first worker model and reasoning policy)
# desc: prose check of /delegate's worker model and reasoning policy: operator selections and
#       exclusions bind, unspecified settings are selected per task with a recorded reason, a
#       native capability check precedes dispatch, requested and observed settings stay separate,
#       an unsupported required control blocks instead of substituting, Sonnet is excluded, max is
#       never passed, low-complexity Claude Code work names Opus with effort judged per task by
#       the advisor, no other skill routes workers to Sonnet, and provider preferences stay
#       separate from the portable role. This probe greps instruction text; it does not verify
#       an effective model or effort setting.
