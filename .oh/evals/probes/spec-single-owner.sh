# source: conversation 2026-06-19 (single-owner implementation workflow, issue #257);
#         renamed from advisor-monitored-loop by issue #928 (retire automated /spec agent handoff);
#         extended by issue #988 / ADR #989 (worker-first implementation under one advisor)
# desc: prose check: /spec execute gives the agent that runs it sole ownership of decisions,
#       acceptance, and the final gates; bounded /delegate workers perform the tracked
#       implementation edits before acceptance, a direct owner edit needs a recorded operator
#       exception, a worker never writes task state, the task stays in the same session unless the
#       operator requests a transfer, and no second owner, supervisor, or
#       separately launched process may reappear
