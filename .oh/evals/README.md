# .oh/evals/ — Context fitness-function probe corpus

This directory is the harness's **fitness function**: a corpus of deterministic
**probes** that turn lessons into runnable, exit-code-scored checks against
*real state*. A rectification is provably "done" when its probe is green; a
recurrence surfaces as a was-green-now-red regression. See
`.oh/tasks/context-fitness-evals/prd.md` for the full design
for how lessons map to probes.

## Subfolders

| Path | Holds |
|------|-------|
| `probes/` | One `<id>.sh` per probe (Tier-A deterministic). |
| `RESULTS.md` | The benchmark scoreboard — current status per probe id (see schema below). |

## Probe contract

A probe is an executable shell script at `.oh/evals/probes/<id>.sh` with a
**3-state exit-code oracle**:

| Exit | Meaning | Counts toward benchmark? |
|------|---------|--------------------------|
| `0` | **PASS** — desired state present / bad condition absent | yes (pass) |
| `1` | **REGRESSION** — the bad condition is present | yes (fail) |
| `2` | **SKIPPED** — not applicable in this environment (e.g. target sandbox absent) | no — neither pass nor regression |

Exit `0` when a probe *cannot verify anything* (e.g. an absent sandbox) is
**forbidden** — use `2` so a silent green never masks an unverifiable check.
Any other non-zero exit is treated as an error (non-PASS). `stderr` MUST carry a
one-line human reason for the result.

### Probe header (metadata)

Every probe declares three comment lines (the runner extracts them with the
exact contract `grep -E '^# (tier|source|desc):'`):

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tier: A          # A
# source: retro lesson 2026-06-04          # the lesson/rule this probe closes
# desc: public mifune.dev is not served by `next dev`
set -euo pipefail
# ... inspect REAL state (running processes, actual files, live sandbox) — never mocks ...
```

Probes MUST inspect real state/artifacts, never synthetic fixtures — except
hook-unit-test probes, which use the documented file-fixture driver pattern
(test driver written to a script file, sensitive tokens in shell variables).

A probe that references repo files MUST resolve the repo root from
`${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` — never cwd, never a hard-coded absolute path. `/eval` runs
probes from an arbitrary working directory, so the canonical preamble is:

```sh
ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../.." && pwd)"   # .oh/evals/probes/<id>.sh -> root
```

### Fault injection — a probe is not green until it has been red

A probe that has only ever been run against a passing repository proves its PASS
branch exists and nothing about whether its oracle can detect the condition it was
written for. Before landing a probe, drive its REGRESSION branch against a
deliberately broken input and confirm it fails for the stated reason.

Commit the work under test **before** injecting faults. A sweep that restores state
with `git checkout -- .` reverts uncommitted edits in the same tree, including the
contract text the probe is meant to guard.

Where the condition lives in git history rather than the working tree, expose the
comparison point as an environment override so the failing branch stays reachable
after the fact — `.oh/evals/probes/wiki-skill-impact-append-only.sh` takes
`WIKI_LEDGER_BASE`, `.oh/evals/probes/wiki-pattern-persistence.sh` takes
`WIKI_PERSISTENCE_BASE`, and `.oh/evals/probes/sandbox-registry.sh` takes
`SANDBOX_REGISTRY_ROOT` (a scratch copy of the tree to assert against), for
exactly this reason. A one-off manual check that leaves no such handle cannot be
repeated by the next author.

Treat `SKIPPED` the same way. A probe whose skip guard can fire in the environment
that normally runs it is unexercised, not healthy; prefer a guard whose absence is
itself a REGRESSION over one that exits 2.

### Boot-path changes are not proven by a local Docker run

A static probe pins the text of a boot contract; it cannot observe whether that
contract boots. Host security modules differ, and the local Docker Desktop / WSL2
daemon does not enforce AppArmor, so a container shape that boots there can still
die at PID 1 on a Linux host. Issue #956 hit exactly this: `cap_add: SYS_ADMIN`
plus `tmpfs: /sys/fs` booted locally, then failed the `sandbox-boot-guard`
workflow with `Failed to mount tmpfs (type tmpfs) on /run … Permission denied`,
because the `docker-default` AppArmor profile denies `mount` even when the
capability is granted.

A change to `.devcontainer/` boot files is validated when
`.github/workflows/sandbox-boot-guard.yml` is green — it builds the image and runs
`.oh/scripts/sandbox-boot-smoke.sh` against a real container on a Linux runner.
Local boots narrow the search; they do not close it. SELinux hosts remain
unexercised by both.

### Pinning contract text

A contract-text probe asserts a document still makes a claim. Pin the shortest
fragment that is still unique — a heading, a table cell, a code token, or four to
six distinctive words. Do not pin a whole prose sentence: `grep -qF` matches within
a single line, so a sentence stored across a hard wrap can never match, and the
assertion breaks on reflow without the contract having changed. Where a whole
sentence is genuinely required, normalize whitespace before matching rather than
pinning the stored bytes.

### Timeout

Every probe must complete within a bounded time; the `/eval` runner wraps each
in `timeout` (default 30s) and marks a hung probe `TIMEOUT` (non-PASS).

## RESULTS.md schema

`RESULTS.md` is the benchmark. Policy: **overwrite the current-status row per
probe id**; git history is the time series (no unbounded append). On the first
run (no prior rows) every probe is emitted as `new-pass`/`new-fail` and NO
`REGRESSION` is raised without a prior state.

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `probe` | probe id (`<id>` of `.oh/evals/probes/<id>.sh`) |
| `tier` | `A` |
| `last-run (UTC)` | timestamp of the most recent `/eval` that ran it |
| `status` | `PASS` \| `REGRESSION` \| `SKIPPED` \| `TIMEOUT` |
| `source` | the lesson/rule the probe closes |

## Correction-surface triage

Not every lesson becomes a probe. Route each lesson to the **cheapest reliable
surface** first:

| Surface | Use when | Artifact |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **harden** | the lesson is a guardrail | a hook + a unit-test probe |
| **proceduralize** | the lesson is a technique | a skill step + a doc-lint probe |
| **eval** | genuine judgment residue only | (Tier-B — deferred; never a hard gate in v1) |

## Runner

`/eval` (`.claude/skills/eval/`) discovers `.oh/evals/probes/*.sh`, runs each, and
writes `RESULTS.md`. The scoreboard is **built into a temp sibling file
(`RESULTS.md.tmp.$$`) and swapped in with a single atomic `mv -f`** — never
truncated-then-appended in place — so a crash or concurrent run can never leave a
partially-written scoreboard. Carry-forward rows for probes not run this
invocation are read from a pre-write snapshot of the original file taken before
the rewrite, never from the live file being replaced, so a filtered run cannot
erase untouched rows. A weekly cron (`crons/eval-weekly.md`) runs it unattended.

### Runner aggregate exit code

The runner's **aggregate** exit code is distinct from the per-probe 3-state
oracle (the `| Exit | Meaning |` table in [Probe contract](#probe-contract)
above, which governs individual probe results).

| Exit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | No new green→red regressions this run. Pre-existing `REGRESSION` rows whose status is unchanged do **not** trigger a non-zero exit. |
| `1` | One or more probes transitioned from a prior `PASS` to `REGRESSION` in this run. |

This `0`/`1` contract is what the `/spec execute` eval gate and the
`eval-weekly` cron rely on when checking whether a run is clean.

## CI gate (`eval-probes`)

The probe suite is wired into `.github/workflows/ci-harness.yml` as a third
independent job, **`eval-probes`** (display name "Eval Probe Regression Gate"),
running in parallel with `ci` and `boot-lint`. Its sole substantive step runs
`bash .claude/skills/eval/run.sh` (the unfiltered runner), and the job — and so
the pipeline — fails **iff** the runner exits non-zero (a new green→red
regression this run). This makes the suite a live PR-time guardrail instead of a
manual-`/eval`-only check.

- **Triggers.** Runs on every pull request and on every push to
  `development`/`main` whose changed paths match the workflow's path filters.
  `.oh/evals/**` is one of those filters, so probe and `RESULTS.md` edits gate
  themselves.
- **Git read-only.** The runner rewrites `.oh/evals/RESULTS.md` in the writable
  checkout (expected), but the job gates **purely on the exit code** — it has no
  `git add`/`commit`/`push` step, so the CI run never persists that churn back to
  the branch.
- **Escape hatch.** There is no merge-bypass label. To unblock a probe that is
  false-failing CI, either (a) re-run the job — via the workflow's
  `workflow_dispatch` trigger (Actions → "CI: Harness" → Run workflow) or by
  re-running the failed check from the PR's Checks tab — if the failure was
  transient, or (b) push a follow-up commit that fixes the offending probe, or
  temporarily removes/SKIPs it (restoring it in a later commit).

The `eval-ci-gate` self-guard probe asserts the runner invocation is still
present in `ci-harness.yml`, so the gate itself cannot be silently deleted.

### Known limitation: `PASS→SKIPPED` is silent in CI

A probe that is `PASS` in the committed `RESULTS.md` baseline but `SKIPPED`
(exit 2) in a cold CI runner — no docker/tmux/systemd/live process — is
**not** a regression: `run.sh:106` flags only a `PASS → REGRESSION|TIMEOUT|ERROR`
transition. This is exactly what keeps the gate hermetic, but it also means a
probe that should be exercising real state can silently degrade to a no-op in CI
without failing the gate. Keeping the committed `RESULTS.md` fresh — so the
baseline reflects each probe's true status — is the **operator's
responsibility**; the `eval-probes` job does not commit or refresh it.
