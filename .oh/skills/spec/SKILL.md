  Canonical build dispatcher and repo-knowledge learning loop. Routes to plan,
  execute, or retro; an approved plan path runs plan then execute. Recalls and
  re-grounds .oh/knowledge/, scaffolds .oh/tasks/<slug>/, implements under one
  owner, and derives knowledge invalidation from the diff. Owns the only build
  path. Procedures: references/{plan,execute,retro}.md.
  TRIGGER when: an approved plan file should become a ready PR without further
  hand-holding, "/spec <plan-path>", "build this plan end to end" -> the default
  plan-then-execute path; a topic/plan/issue needs to become a buildable task
  folder without building it, "plan <topic>", "scaffold the task for <issue>"
  -> plan; an approved .oh/tasks/<slug>/ folder needs building to a promotable
  PR, "execute <slug>", "build <slug>" -> execute; a build PASSed audit and its
  lessons should be captured, "retro the <slug> build" -> retro.

# /spec — canonical workflow dispatcher

`/spec <subcommand> [args]` is the single entry point to the decomposed
`spec-*` workflow nodes. The first whitespace-delimited token of `$ARGUMENTS`
selects the subcommand; everything after it is that subcommand's own argument
string. Each subcommand's full procedure lives in a reference doc under
`references/` — read that doc and follow it as the authoritative instructions.

**An unrecognized first token is not an error — it is an approved plan path.**
`/spec <plan-path>` is the ordinary way in: it scaffolds the task folder and then
builds it through to a ready-for-review pull request. Naming a node explicitly
(`plan`, `execute`) runs only that node, which is what fan-out and recovery need.

This is the **only** spec pipeline; there is no all-in-one composer beside it.
`references/execute.md` holds the build mechanics in full — the issue, the
branch, the draft PR, the implementation step, the `/eval` and knowledge gates, the
promotable classification, and the undraft — so learning what the build does
never sends a reader to a second skill.

## The loop

`/spec` is where accumulated repository understanding is consumed, re-verified,
spent, and replenished. Knowledge is a derived cache; the repository is the
source of truth.

```text
operator intent
    ↓
/spec plan  ──▶ recall tracked knowledge (.oh/knowledge/, /wiki query)
                     ↓
                verify claims against current code / tests / docs
                     ↓
                prd.md (Knowledge Context · Expected Knowledge Impact ·
                        Plan Reconciliation) + prd.json
    ↓
/spec execute ─▶ re-ground against current HEAD
                     ↓
                implementation ⇄ audit  →  /eval (once)
                     ↓
                Actual Knowledge Impact = expected + actual diff + dependencies
                     ↓
                update / reverify affected pages
                     ↓
                evidence.md → retro → /wiki compile
    ↓
future /spec plan reads what this run learned
```

Two rules keep the loop honest:

- **Knowledge informs; it never authorizes.** A recalled page is orientation.
  Code and tests are implementation truth; canonical docs and RFCs are
  intended-design truth. A material claim is re-grounded before it is relied on.
- **The planner predicts, the diff decides.** `Expected Knowledge Impact` is the
  planner's guess. The final impact is derived from the actual changed paths and
  the pages' declared dependencies, because implementation touches paths the
  planner never saw.

## Workflow contract

The canonical operative path is
`spec-plan → spec-execute → merge → reset|clean`.

There is no automated selection node. A human selects the work and approves
`prd.md`; that approval is the commitment gate. **Handing `/spec` an approved
plan file satisfies that gate** — writing the plan and passing it in *is* the
operator's approval, so the default path carries it through to `execute` without
a second prompt. A bare topic with no plan file has no such approval behind it:
the run stops after `plan` and hands the operator the folder to approve.

**Approval covers the intent that was approved, not whatever grounding turns it
into.** If `plan`'s grounding step finds that satisfying the approved plan
requires a *material* change to the operator's intent, the run stops and asks for
re-approval rather than treating the original approval as covering the new shape
(`references/plan.md`, `## Plan Reconciliation`).

`/spec execute` stops at a ready-for-review pull request. The human alone merges.
The runner performs `reset` or `clean`.

### The task folder

The `.oh/tasks/<slug>/` folder is the interface between the subcommands:

```text
.oh/tasks/<slug>/
├── prd.md            the approved plan, with its knowledge sections
├── prd.json          the ordered task graph — and the authoritative completion state
├── progress.txt      the execution narrative and resume evidence
├── evidence.md       written after implementation; gates the undraft
└── eval-result.json  the commit-keyed probe-suite result, when applicable
```

There is **no generated `prompt.md`**. The task prompt is rendered at
execution time from `templates/task-prompt.md` plus `prd.md` and `prd.json`; a
persisted copy of a template only drifts from it.

**Completion is structured state.** A task is complete when every story in
`prd.json` has `"passes": true` — `jq -e 'all(.userStories[]; .passes == true)'`.
There is no prose sentinel in `progress.txt`; a second representation of
completion is a second thing that can be wrong.

### Execution lifecycle

`execute` can return before the build finishes — a cron or a resumed run reaches
this line with stories still open — so it reports the state it actually reached:

```text
PLANNED ──▶ RUNNING ──▶ READY
                   └──▶ DRAFT-BLOCKED(<gate>)
```

`RUNNING` is a real state, not ceremony — and it is a state of the **task**, not
of a process: an approved folder whose stories are not all `passes: true`. The
owner mirrors it into `/tmp/spec-<slug>.state` at every phase change so resume,
watchdog, and operator visibility have something to read. `execute` returning
before the build finishes is reported as `RUNNING`, never as `READY`.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand | Arg shape | Purpose | Procedure |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plan` | `<topic> [--plan <path>] [--issue <N>] [--slug <slug>] [--prefix <type>] [--repo <o/n>] [--base <branch>]` | Recall tracked knowledge, re-ground it, and turn a topic/plan/issue into a scaffolded `.oh/tasks/<slug>/` folder | `references/plan.md` |
| `execute` | `<slug> [--pr <N>] [--repo <o/n>] [--remote <name>] [--base <branch>]` | Re-ground, then `implementation ⇄ audit → eval → knowledge impact → evidence → retro → compile → benchmark` to a ready PR, stopping at the human merge gate | `references/execute.md` |
| `retro` | `<slug> [--dry-run]` | Compatibility wrapper for `/retro --task <slug>` | `references/retro.md` |
| *(default)* | `<plan-path>` | `plan` then `execute` — the approved-plan path. Selected by any first token that is not a node name | this file, plus both procedures |

## Dispatch

1. Split `$ARGUMENTS`: `SUB` = the first token; `REST` = everything after it.
2. When `SUB` names a node (`plan`, `execute`, `retro`), read
   `references/<SUB>.md` and follow it, treating `REST` as that doc's
   `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g. for `/spec plan <topic> --issue 7`, the plan procedure sees
   `<topic> --issue 7`).
3. **Any other non-empty `$ARGUMENTS` is the approved-plan path.** Run
   `references/plan.md` with the whole string, verify the three-file contract,
   then run `references/execute.md` with the resulting `<slug>`. Do not print
   usage for an argument that merely fails to name a node; a plan path is the
   expected input.
4. Empty `$ARGUMENTS` → print the Subcommands table as usage and stop.

```bash
SUB="${ARGUMENTS%% *}"                          # first token
REST="${ARGUMENTS#"$SUB"}"; REST="${REST# }"    # remainder
case "$SUB" in
  plan|execute|retro)
    # read references/$SUB.md and execute it with REST as its $ARGUMENTS
    ;;
  ship)
    # `ship` is retired: it owned no mechanics of its own. Say so once, then
    # treat REST as the plan path so the slug is not derived from the word.
    echo "note: 'ship' was retired; /spec <plan-path> runs plan then execute"
    # continue at step 3 with REST
    ;;
  "")
    echo "usage: /spec <plan-path> | plan <topic> | execute <slug> | retro <slug>"
    ;;
  *)
    # DEFAULT: an approved plan path -> plan, then execute
    ;;
esac
```

## Shared rules (apply to every subcommand)

- **This skill owns the workflow** — keep the operative path, human selection,
  plan-approval gate, evidence gate, and human merge boundary in this skill and
  its three direct references. Do not duplicate the workflow in root
  instructions.
- **The `.oh/tasks/<slug>/` folder is the universal interface** — `plan` produces
  it; `execute` and `retro` are each pointed at it. The `<slug>` is the universal
  key (task directory, branch second segment, status file). It is never a terminal
  identifier: no session, tab, or pane name is derived from it, and none is read
  back to decide task state.
- **One owner builds it — the agent that is running `execute`** — implementation
  and every post-build gate belong to that agent.
  **`/spec` never launches another coding-agent process to do that work**:
  no multiplexer session, no Herdr
  workspace/tab/pane, no background shell, no runner selection. `/delegate` is
  available only for bounded, disjoint worker tasks; a worker never becomes a
  second supervisor, executor, or PR owner, and the owner reconciles and validates
  every result.
- **Compose, don't fork** — each node reuses existing skills rather than
  re-implementing them: `plan` composes `/wiki query` + `/prd` + `/ralph`;
  `execute` composes `/audit implementation` + `/eval` + `knowledge-impact.sh` +
  `/wiki compile` + `/benchmark` + `/audit pr`; `retro` composes `/retro`. The
  build **literals** — the `gh` invocations, the branch and PR shapes, the
  implementation step, and the handoff-free implementation rules — live in
  `references/execute.md`, which is the single source for them and is a
  protected path.
- **Dependency-aware invalidation lives in the knowledge primitive** —
  `.oh/skills/wiki/scripts/knowledge-impact.sh`. `/spec` calls it; it does not
  carry a second copy of the logic.
- **One adversarial loop** — `implementation ⇄ audit` inside `execute` vets the
  implementation (`AUDIT-FAIL` routes back to the same owner). The plan
  itself is vetted by the operator who approves it, and re-approved if grounding
  materially changes it.
- **Distil before you compress** — high-resolution execution evidence is turned
  into `evidence.md`, a retro, and durable patterns *before* any context
  compression. Compaction is a runtime optimization, non-gating, and never a
  semantic stage of the build.
- **Honest terminal reports** — each subcommand reports what it actually
  produced: `plan` the folder path and story count; `execute` `RUNNING` when it
  returns with the task still building, and `READY` or `DRAFT-BLOCKED(<gate>)`
  with the PR URL when the build reaches a terminal state; `retro` the promotion counts. Never
  infer success from silence. A missing artifact, a crashed build, or an
  undecided gate is reported as blocked, never as done.

## When NOT to use

- **selection** — choosing which issue to build is the human's job; `/spec`
  builds the one plan or folder it is handed.
