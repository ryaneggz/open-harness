## [2026.5.1] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- README "Docker only (no installer)" section — concise compose-based deploy path for hosts that have only Docker + git.
- Per-page OpenGraph + canonical link tags via theme.config.tsx head function ([#140](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/issues/140)).
- Blog post draft: Worktree-per-agent — stages for Wed publish ([#145](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/pull/145)).
- Blog section at /blog and About page nav entry (#143).
- Blog post: BYOH — stop installing agent CLIs on your laptop (#144).
- Root `CHANGELOG.md` and Keep-a-Changelog workflow documented in `.claude/rules/git.md`; `/release` now promotes `[Unreleased]` to the new version section at tag time.
- Generate `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` during docs build via `next-sitemap` ([#141](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/issues/141)).
- Launch runbook consolidating manual cutover steps (DNS, GH settings, OG validation, GSC, promotion).
- Docusaurus v3 docs site at `apps/docs` deployed to oh.mifune.dev ([#164](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/issues/164)).

### Changed
- `install.sh` curl-pipe target renamed `~/.openharness` → `~/openharness` so the cloned project no longer collides with the in-repo `.openharness/` config dir (`~/.openharness/.openharness/` was visually and semantically confusing). One-time migration: existing `~/.openharness` clones are `mv`'d to `~/openharness` automatically when the new path is absent. In-container paths (`/home/sandbox/.openharness`) are unchanged. ([#200](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/issues/200))
- Reverted the sandbox/orchestrator vocabulary realignment ([#170](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/issues/170), [#172](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/issues/172)). The in-container Linux user is `sandbox` again (UID/GID 1000 preserved); the `ORCHESTRATOR_USER`/`ORCHESTRATOR_HOME` constants are removed. The package name `@openharness/sandbox`, compose service, container default, `SANDBOX_NAME` env var, `POSTGRES_USER`, and `sandbox_*` Pi tool prefix were never changed. `install/banner.sh` carries an inverted migration guard for users coming back from a renamed image. ([#198](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/issues/198))
- Consolidate documentation: `/docs/` is now the single source of truth, served by Docusaurus from `apps/docs/` via `path: '../../docs'`. Enabled blog at `/blog/`. Removed the duplicate `apps/docs/docs/` tree. ([#178](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/pull/178))
- Installer auto-detects Node 20+; new `--cli` / `--docker-only` / `--install-node` flags; `--with-cli` deprecated. ([#176](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/pull/176)).
- README and installation docs now use the short `https://oh.mifune.dev/install.sh` URL (302 redirect to the raw GitHub install script on `main`) instead of the long `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL.
- `/release` now executes the `[Unreleased]` → `[$VERSION]` promotion (was prose-only) and `release.yml` sources the GitHub Release body from the promoted CHANGELOG section via `body_path` instead of `generate_release_notes`, so the GitHub Release notes match the changelog byte-for-byte.
- Revert prior secondary product name; "Open Harness" is the sole brand across README, docs, and onboarding ([#157](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/issues/157)).
- Cloudflare onboarding step now requires an explicit public hostname (no default domain) ([#157](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/issues/157)).
- Slim README to ~110 lines, lead with oh CLI flow (#139).
- Wiki promoted from `workspace/wiki/` to `docs/wiki/` — same structure (`pages/`, `sources/`, `index.md`, `log.md`), now top-level alongside human-curated docs.
- 26 docs pages converted from Nextra MDX to plain markdown rendered by GitHub.

### Fixed
- `install.sh` now auto-disables the `*-host.yml` overlays in `.openharness/config.json` when host UID ≠ 1000 (was: a multi-line warning telling the user to do it by hand). Mode-0600 credential files in `~/.claude` / `~/.codex` / `~/.pi` can't be read across UIDs, and mode-0700 dirs (e.g. `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`) reject writes from non-owner UIDs — the sandbox user (UID 1000) would EACCES on `oh` / `claude` / `codex` / `pi`. The new logic uses `jq` to filter `claude-host.yml`, `codex-host.yml`, `pi-host.yml` out of `composeOverrides` so the base named volumes take over. The original warning is retained as a `jq`-missing fallback. ([#202](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/issues/202))
- Host auth (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.pi`) is shared into the sandbox again. `install.sh` now pre-creates the three auth dirs and `~/.claude.json` (empty if missing) before sandbox bring-up so docker can't auto-create them root-owned, and `claude-host.yml` / `codex-host.yml` / `pi-host.yml` are restored to default `composeOverrides`. UID-mismatch hosts (UID ≠ 1000) get a loud install-time warning telling them to drop the overlays from `.openharness/config.json` (mode-0600 credential files can't be read across UIDs). Together this restores the convenience that was lost in #194 / #195 without re-introducing the EACCES failure mode that motivated those PRs. ([#196](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/issues/196))
- `oh` / `claude` / `codex` no longer fail with `EACCES` (or silent re-auth) on fresh `install.sh` installs. Removed `docker-compose.claude-host.yml`, `docker-compose.codex-host.yml`, and `docker-compose.pi-host.yml` from the default `composeOverrides` in `.openharness/config.json`. Each overlay's own header documents that it requires host UID 1000 + the source dir to pre-exist; shipping them as defaults broke any host where either condition wasn't met (docker auto-creates missing source dirs as root → sandbox user (UID 1000) can't write). The base compose's `claude-auth` / `codex-auth` / `pi-auth` named volumes now take effect by default; `entrypoint.sh` chowns them to UID 1000 on first boot. Single-laptop developers wanting cross-sandbox auth sharing can opt back in by appending the relevant overlay(s) to `.openharness/config.json`. ([#194](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/issues/194))
- `oh sandbox` no longer fails on fresh `install.sh` installs with a Caddyfile bind-mount error. Removed `docker-compose.gateway.yml` and `docker-compose.cloudflared.yml` from the default `composeOverrides` in `.openharness/config.json`; both are additive overlays now loaded only when needed (`oh expose` re-adds the gateway via `SandboxConfig.addOverride()`). ([#192](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/issues/192))
- `install.sh` next-steps now leads with a numbered "source your shell rc" step that detects `$SHELL` (`bash` → `~/.bashrc`, `zsh` → `~/.zshrc`, `fish` → `~/.config/fish/config.fish`) so users don't have to exit + reopen their shell to pick up `oh` / `node` / `pnpm`. Curl-piped install runs in a child bash whose exports cannot reach the parent shell — the source step is now Step 1 of next-steps (was a buried "Reminder").
- `install.sh` bootstraps `PNPM_HOME` before `pnpm link --global` so the CLI install no longer dies with `ERR_PNPM_NO_GLOBAL_BIN_DIR` on fresh nvm-installed Node. Runs `pnpm setup` (writes `PNPM_HOME` export to `~/.bashrc` + `~/.zshrc`) and also exports `PNPM_HOME`/`PATH` inline so the link step succeeds in the current shell regardless of rc state.
- `install.sh` no longer silently exits when sourcing a pre-existing `~/.nvm/nvm.sh` under `set -euo pipefail`. nvm + corepack calls are bracketed with relaxed strict mode and explicit `$?` checks, an `ERR` trap surfaces unexpected failures with the failing command and line, and pnpm is pinned to `10.33.0` (matches `package.json#packageManager`) instead of resolving `pnpm@latest` over the network on every install.
- Slack bot no longer drops oversized agent replies with cascading `msg_too_long` errors. Main message is capped at 2,900 chars with a `_message truncated — full response in thread_` footer; full content spills to thread replies; `setWorking(false)` always clears the working indicator. ([#135](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/issues/135))

### Removed
- Removed legacy `/docs/{plans,wiki,launch-runbook,blog}/` and `apps/docs/docs/` tree (consolidated into `/docs/`). ([#178](https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness/pull/178))
- Nextra docs site and the `.github/workflows/docs.yml` deployment — documentation is now plain markdown in `docs/`, read in the GitHub UI.
- Reference Next.js application at `workspace/projects/next-app/`, along with its CI jobs (`workspace/projects/next-app` paths in `ci.yml` / `release.yml`) and the release pre-flight gate referencing it.
- Root `package.json` scripts: `dev`, `docs:dev`, `docs:build`, `docs:preview`.

### Deprecated
### Security
