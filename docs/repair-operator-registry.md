# Repair-operator registry

A named catalogue of the **repair classes** the self-improving harness may
apply to itself, ordered by how much trust each one is granted before it may
touch state. This is the concrete realization of item 7 of the
[self-improving harness roadmap](rfcs/rfc-selfimprove-roadmap.md) — *"Scoped
repair-operator registry … define safe-by-default, stronger-gate, and
human-approval-required repair classes that proposal generation and audit can
enforce."*

**This registry documents behavior the harness already enforces; it adds no
new runtime machinery.** Each tier below points at the *existing* mechanism
that already draws the line — a proposal generator or an auditor cites this
page instead of re-deriving the boundary.

> **The safe tier is guarded by a path set, not a hook.** There is no
> `owned-surface-guard` *hook* on disk, and since 0.3.0 there is no enforcing
> script either: the `OWNED_PATHS` array lived in `.agro/skills/autopilot/SKILL.md`
> and was removed with that loop, along with the
> `.agro/evals/probes/owned-surface-guard.sh` probe that tested it. **This page is
> now the source of truth for the tier-1 path set** — it is doctrine a reviewer
> applies, not a check a runtime performs.

## Tier 1 — safe-by-default

Edits confined to the harness-infra self-edit surface. A repair whose entire
file set is inside this surface is **safe-by-default** — no extra gate beyond the
standard build ⇄ audit loop and the human merge.

**Source of truth — the tier-1 path set, defined here since 0.3.0:**

```bash
OWNED_PATHS=(.claude/ docs/ scripts/ crons/ .agro/skills/wiki/ .agro/evals/ .agro/tasks/ CHANGELOG.md)
```

The tier-1 surface is exactly those ten tokens, verbatim:

```
.claude/
docs/
scripts/
crons/
.agro/skills/wiki/
.agro/evals/
.agro/tasks/
CHANGELOG.md
```

*Runner-logic distinction (prose, not a second tier):* the `scripts/` surface
holds workflow code such as the `/spec execute` implementation cycle. **Editing** such a file is
safe-by-default (it is in the set above); what raises operational caution is
changing a runner's *runtime behavior*, which is reviewed at the human merge
gate — the file's home tier does not change, and no path here is repeated in
Tier 2 or Tier 3.

## Tier 2 — stronger-gate

Repairs that reach toward secret-exposure or network surfaces pass a
**deterministic pre-tool-use gate** before any command or file read executes.
The gate holds even when the interactive permission engine is bypassed, so the
line is drawn by code, not by model self-restraint. A repair-operator proposal
whose commands touch these surfaces is *stronger-gate* — it is not forbidden,
but it must survive the guard below.

Enforcers (cite these; do not rebuild them):

- `deny-env-dump.sh` — `PreToolUse` `Bash` scanner: **denies** bulk env dumps,
  history dumps, token-printing CLIs, and secret-named-variable echoes;
  **asks** on narrow reads that might be public.
- `deny-secret-paths.sh` — `PreToolUse` `Read|Write|Edit|NotebookEdit` guard:
  blocks the credential-path family (env files, private keys, `.netrc`, shell
  history, cloud/kube config) for the file tools.
- `warn-devtcp.sh` — non-blocking `PreToolUse` warning when a command uses a
  raw `/dev/tcp` or `/dev/udp` socket.
- Backing deny-list + wiring: the `settings.json` permission deny-list, which
  the hooks re-assert under `bypassPermissions`. See
  `security-considerations.md §2` (secret-exposure guards) for the full model.

## Tier 3 — human-approval-required

Repairs that a machine may **propose but never land on its own**. The authority
is a human, applied at a review gate; no automation merges these.

- Sandbox **application code** (business logic, APIs, UIs) is out of bounds for
  the unattended loop entirely. Root `AGENTS.md` § "Agent work stays inside the
  sandbox" states the scope boundary. `security-considerations.md §5` mirrors it.
- Any change to the trunk itself: no agent merges its own work. The canonical
  path in `.agro/skills/spec/SKILL.md` ends `… → merge (human) → reset|clean`,
  and the loop is rate-capped and never auto-merges. See
  `security-considerations.md §4` (human merge gate / no auto-merge).
- The ultimate hard gate for this tier is server-side branch protection on the
  trunk, which lives in repo settings rather than this tree.

## Tier → enforcer summary

| Tier | Repair class | Drawn by |
|------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | safe-by-default | the tier-1 self-edit surface — this page § Tier 1` |
| 2 | stronger-gate | `deny-env-dump.sh` · `deny-secret-paths.sh` · `warn-devtcp.sh` + `security-considerations.md §2` |
| 3 | human-approval-required | `AGENTS.md` § "Agent work stays inside the sandbox" · `.agro/skills/spec/SKILL.md` § Workflow contract · `security-considerations.md §4`/`§5` |

Each token in the Tier 1 surface belongs to Tier 1 only; Tiers 2 and 3 name
*mechanisms and prose boundaries*, never a Tier 1 path, so no surface is
classified twice.
