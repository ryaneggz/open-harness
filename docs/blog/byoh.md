# BYOH — stop installing agent CLIs on your laptop

I ran `ls ~/.nvm/versions/node` last week and counted **14 Node versions**. Three Pythons in `pyenv`. A Rust toolchain I'm pretty sure I installed for one Tauri experiment in 2023. A `~/.local/share/pnpm/global` directory that npm wouldn't admit existed. My laptop was a museum of dependency archaeology.

The trigger was Codex. I wanted to try OpenAI's CLI alongside Claude Code. Step one of the install was "make sure you're on Node 20." Step two of the Gemini CLI was "make sure you're on Node 22." Step three of Pi (the agent runtime I actually wanted to glue everything together) was "we recommend a clean Python 3.11 venv." Each agent CLI was a fresh archaeology dig and a fresh chance to break the other two.

I gave up. I containerized the whole thing. Now my laptop runs Docker and one binary, and **every** agent CLI lives inside a sandbox I can blow away in a second.

It's called Open Harness. The pattern is BYOH — Bring Your Own Harness. Here's the part that actually changed my workflow.

## The aha — three commands, every agent

```bash
oh sandbox my-agent     # build + start sandbox
oh shell my-agent       # drop into a zsh inside it
oh clean my-agent       # blow it away
```

That's it. The sandbox is a Debian container with Claude Code, Codex, the Gemini CLI, and Pi all preinstalled, on the right Node, on the right Python, with `gh`, `tmux`, `docker` (mounted socket), and the rest of the toolchain already wired. First run prompts `oh onboard` for OAuth flows — Slack, GitHub, Cloudflare, your LLM keys — once, then never again.

No more "let me just upgrade brew first." No more "this CLI needs Node 22 and breaks on 24." The host stays clean. The sandbox does the work.

## What you get out of the box

Inside the container, on day one:

- **Four agent CLIs**: `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `pi` — all current, all isolated.
- **Identity files**: `SOUL.md` (persona), `MEMORY.md` (long-term notes), `AGENTS.md` (in-sandbox instructions). Every agent reads them; you edit them once.
- **Heartbeats**: cron-style YAML in `workspace/heartbeats/*.md`. The Pi daemon fires them on schedule — daily wiki lints, hourly PR babysitting, whatever you want.
- **A Slack bot** (`pi-mom`) that proxies the agent into a channel. Mention it, get a thread reply, work from your phone.
- **Cloudflare tunnel exposure**: `oh expose docs 3000` puts a dev server on the public internet at `https://docs.<sandbox>.<your-domain>` with real TLS. No port forwarding, no `ngrok` tab.
- **A docker socket** the agent can use — so the agent inside the sandbox can spin up _its own_ throwaway containers for tests, builds, browsers.

The sandbox is the unit. You can have one for work, one for a weekend project, one for the AI side-quest you don't want polluting the others.

## The unlock — agents racing each other

Here's the part I didn't expect.

Once every CLI lives inside one sandbox, **running them in parallel is trivial**. I open three tmux panes:

```bash
tmux new-session  -d -s race 'cd .worktrees/feat-x-claude  && claude'
tmux split-window -t race    'cd .worktrees/feat-x-codex   && codex'
tmux split-window -t race    'cd .worktrees/feat-x-gemini  && gemini'
```

Three worktrees, three branches, three agents, same prompt. Twenty minutes later I `git diff` the branches and pick the implementation I like best — or cherry-pick the good ideas across all three. Claude usually wins on architecture, Codex usually wins on test coverage, Gemini occasionally surprises me on a corner case. The point isn't which one wins; it's that **comparison is now cheap**.

You can't do this when each CLI demands a different Node version on the host. You _can_ do it when they all share one well-tuned container. That's the actual product.

## Try it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryaneggz/open-harness.git
cd open-harness
docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
docker exec -it -u sandbox openharness zsh
```

Or, after the first sandbox: `oh sandbox <name>` from anywhere.

Issues and PRs welcome — the fastest way to make BYOH better is to bring _your_ harness rules and tell me what's missing.

Wednesday's post: **one worktree per agent** — the git pattern that makes the three-pane race above safe to run on your real codebase.
