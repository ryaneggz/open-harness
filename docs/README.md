# Open Harness docs

📖 **Full rendered docs & search → https://oh.mifune.dev**

GitHub-readable documentation for the core Open Harness repo. Prefer this index
for repo-local docs and [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/mifunedev/openharness)
for generated codebase navigation. The rendered Docusaurus site and blog archive
live in [`mifunedev/openharness-web`](https://github.com/mifunedev/openharness-web).

## Start here

Open Harness provides the sandbox; you choose the harness — a Docker workspace you
clone-and-own, where `oh sandbox install docker` boots one long-lived container and the coding agent
of your choice (Claude Code, Codex, Pi, Hermes, and more) works on its own branch and
identity, running identically on your laptop or an unattended, lights-out remote VM.

**Attach in 3 steps (VS Code):**

1. `oh sandbox install docker` — write the registry entry and boot the container.
2. VS Code → Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P) → "Dev Containers: Attach to Running
   Container" → select `openharness`. Ports auto-forward while attached.
3. Open a terminal and run `oh tool install herdr`, then `herdr`. Nothing installs at boot, so install each agent the same way — `oh harness install claude-code`, `codex`, `pi`, or `hermes` — then launch it from a Herdr pane.

Full terminal, VS Code, and Remote-SSH options: see [Connecting to the sandbox](connecting.md).

[Hermes](harnesses/hermes.md) — Nous Research's self-improving agent CLI — installs
like every other harness: run `oh harness install hermes`, then `hermes setup`.

## How the primitive pack ships

Open Harness vendors the shared skills/hooks primitive pack directly into the `.oh/` control plane (`.oh/skills/`, `.oh/hooks/`, `.oh/skills.lock`), tracked as ordinary files — `oh update` lays them down, so a fresh checkout has them with no submodule or network step. Provider paths such as `.pi/skills`, `.claude/skills`, and `.codex/skills` are symlinks into `.oh/skills`; `.pi/` remains a provider surface for v1.
