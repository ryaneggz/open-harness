# Agents Overview

Open Harness supports four AI coding agents out of the box: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Pi Agent. All four are installed into the same sandbox image and can run side-by-side, each in its own git worktree, with its own identity and its own cron schedule.

## Why run multiple agents at once?

Different agents have different strengths. Running them in parallel lets you route tasks by capability — long-horizon planning in one agent, rapid iteration in another, Slack-driven automation in a third — without spinning up separate machines or fighting over a shared working tree.

Open Harness makes this practical by giving each agent:

- **Its own worktree** — separate branch, no merge conflicts mid-task.
- **Its own SOUL** — a `SOUL.md` persona file that shapes the agent's tone and priorities.
- **Its own schedule** — heartbeat files in `workspace/heartbeats/` drive cron-based autonomous runs independent of what other agents are doing.

## Supported agents

| Agent | Role | Start command |
|---|---|---|
| [Claude Code](./claude-code.md) | General-purpose terminal coding agent | `claude` |
| [Codex](./codex.md) | Fully autonomous code generation and editing | `codex` |
| [Gemini CLI](./gemini.md) | Google Gemini-powered CLI agent | `gemini` |
| [Pi Agent](./pi.md) | Automations, Slack, heartbeats, and extensions | `pi` |

## Installation

All four agents are installed during sandbox setup via `install/setup.sh`. Claude Code, Codex, and Pi Agent are installed by default. Gemini CLI is available as an additional install. Each is available system-wide in the sandbox after provisioning:

```bash
claude --version
codex --version
pi --version
gemini --version
```

## Running agents in parallel

Use separate tmux sessions so each agent's output stays isolated and survives disconnects:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s agent-claude 'claude'
tmux new-session -d -s agent-codex  'codex --full-auto'
tmux new-session -d -s agent-pi     'pi'
```

Attach to any session at any time:

```bash
tmux attach -t agent-claude
```

See the individual agent pages for auth setup and usage examples.
