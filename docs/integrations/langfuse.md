# Langfuse

[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is optional, external observability for **Pi**
and **Claude Code** sessions. Open Harness does not bundle or operate Langfuse:
deploy it separately (Langfuse Cloud or your own installation) and follow the
[official Docker Compose deployment guide](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting/deployment/docker-compose)
if you self-host. Secure that external service with appropriate access controls
and TLS.

The two integrations provide end-to-end observability, **not identical event
schemas or privacy controls**. In particular, Pi supports deliberate capture
presets including `metadata-only`; the Claude Code plugin does not. Read the
privacy sections for the CLI you use before enabling either integration.

## Pi

[`pi-langfuse` v1.5.9](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-langfuse/v/1.5.9) is a
Pi package. While the upstream shutdown fix is under review, Open Harness uses
the maintained fork at commit
[`51a59c854859bbb08a43baad98f0b9eb4a94588c`](https://github.com/ryaneggz/pi-langfuse/commit/51a59c854859bbb08a43baad98f0b9eb4a94588c),
which is the source for upstream PR
[#14](https://github.com/gooyoung/pi-langfuse/pull/14). Pi packages can execute
arbitrary code, so review that source before installing it.

Install the pinned fork through the repository-owned helper:

```bash
bash .pi/install/install-langfuse.sh
```

The helper installs the fork commit in user scope through Pi's managed npm
root, registers the installed path with Pi, applies the scoped
`@opentelemetry/sdk-node@0.220.0` override, verifies the package lock resolves
the exact reviewed commit, and requires a clean `npm audit`. The upstream fix
classifies only an `AbortError` caused by pi-langfuse's own shutdown controller
as an expected bounded timeout; with `PI_LANGFUSE_DEBUG=1` it remains visible as
a debug message, while other shutdown errors still update runtime status and
emit the normal warning. Rerun the helper after any package reinstall or `~/.pi`
volume reset. The OpenTelemetry override remediates the vulnerable tree selected
by pi-langfuse's declared `^0.218.0` range without npm audit's unsafe
recommendation to downgrade pi-langfuse to `1.0.0`; unrelated npm overrides are
preserved.

This fork pin is temporary and intentionally immutable. If upstream merges and
publishes #14, migrate the installer to that reviewed upstream release in a
separate change; do not follow a moving branch automatically.

This is deliberately **not** an Open Harness default package. It instruments Pi
sessions only; it does not instrument standalone Claude Code, Codex CLI, or
Gemini CLI sessions.

### Local self-hosted setup walkthrough

The following procedure mirrors a working local installation: clone Langfuse as
an independent project under Open Harness's `projects/` namespace,
start its Compose stack, attach the existing sandbox to Langfuse's Docker
network, and configure Pi against the service hostname. The same service can be
used by Claude Code after completing steps 1–5; see [Claude Code](#claude-code)
for its plugin configuration.

Commands run from the normal host terminal unless marked **SANDBOX** or **PI**.

#### 1. Clone Langfuse under `projects/`

Start from the Open Harness checkout:

```bash
cd /path/to/openharness
PROJECTS_ROOT="$(bash .agro/scripts/oh-path projects --no-create 2>/dev/null || printf '%s' projects)"
mkdir -p "$PROJECTS_ROOT/langfuse"
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git \
  "$PROJECTS_ROOT/langfuse/langfuse"
cd "$PROJECTS_ROOT/langfuse/langfuse"
```

This is an independent repository with its own `.git`, not a harness branch or
Git worktree. Its own worktrees, if any, live at
`projects/langfuse/langfuse/.worktrees/`. If it is already cloned, update it instead:

```bash
cd /path/to/openharness
PROJECTS_ROOT="$(bash .agro/scripts/oh-path projects --no-create 2>/dev/null || printf '%s' projects)"
cd "$PROJECTS_ROOT/langfuse/langfuse"
git pull --ff-only
```

#### 2. Start and verify Langfuse

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait --wait-timeout 300
docker compose ps
curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/api/public/health
```

A failed health check can be investigated with:

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=200
```

#### 3. Start the sandbox and discover Langfuse's network

```bash
docker start oh-sbx-local
LANGFUSE_WEB_ID=$(docker compose ps -q langfuse-web)
LANGFUSE_NETWORK=$(
  docker inspect "$LANGFUSE_WEB_ID" \
    --format '{{range $name, $_ := .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{$name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}' |
  head -n 1
)
printf 'Langfuse container: %s\nLangfuse network: %s\n' \
  "$LANGFUSE_WEB_ID" "$LANGFUSE_NETWORK"
```

Run these commands from the cloned Langfuse repository so `docker compose`
selects its Compose project.

#### 4. Attach the sandbox to Langfuse

The conditional network attachment is idempotent:

```bash
docker inspect oh-sbx-local \
  --format '{{range $name, $_ := .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{$name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}' |
  grep -Fxq "$LANGFUSE_NETWORK" ||
  docker network connect "$LANGFUSE_NETWORK" oh-sbx-local
```

Confirm that both containers share the network, then verify DNS and HTTP from
the sandbox:

```bash
docker network inspect "$LANGFUSE_NETWORK" \
  --format '{{range .Containers}}{{println .Name}}{{end}}' |
  sort

docker exec -u sandbox oh-sbx-local getent hosts langfuse-web
docker exec -u sandbox oh-sbx-local \
  curl -fsS http://langfuse-web:3000/api/public/health
```

Compose may prefix the Langfuse container's displayed name. The service DNS
name remains `langfuse-web`. Repeat the network attachment whenever the
`oh-sbx-local` container is destroyed and recreated.

#### 5. Create the local user, project, and keys

Open <http://localhost:3000> on the host and:

1. Select **Sign up** and create the initial local user.
2. Sign in and create an organization when prompted.
3. Create a project, for example `openharness-local`.
4. Open **Settings → API Keys** and select **Create new API keys**.
5. Copy the public key (`pk-lf-...`) and secret key (`sk-lf-...`) while shown.

Keep the secret key out of source files, shell history, screenshots, and chat.

#### 6. Install and configure Pi

Enter the existing sandbox:

```bash
docker exec -it -u sandbox oh-sbx-local bash
```

Then run these commands in the **SANDBOX**:

```bash
pi --version
bash .pi/install/install-langfuse.sh
pi list
export LANGFUSE_PRIVACY_PRESET=metadata-only
pi
```

At the **PI** prompt, run `/langfuse-setup` and enter:

```text
Public key:  pk-lf-...
Secret key:  sk-lf-...
Langfuse URL: http://langfuse-web:3000
```

Do not use `localhost` here: inside the sandbox it refers to the sandbox, not
the Langfuse container. The saved configuration lives at
`~/.pi/agent/pi-langfuse/config.json` on Open Harness's persistent `pi-auth`
volume.

#### 7. Verify Pi tracing and permissions

At the **PI** prompt:

1. Run `/langfuse-status`; confirm the masked public key, host
   `http://langfuse-web:3000`, `metadata-only` privacy, and no runtime error.
2. Run `/langfuse-test`; confirm the test trace appears in the local project.
3. Send a normal prompt and confirm its session trace appears as well.

Exit Pi, then verify restrictive permissions from the **SANDBOX** without
printing the credential file:

```bash
stat -c '%a %n' \
  ~/.pi/agent/pi-langfuse \
  ~/.pi/agent/pi-langfuse/config.json
```

Expected permissions are `700` for the directory and `600` for the file. Keep
`LANGFUSE_PRIVACY_PRESET=metadata-only` set before future Pi launches unless a
broader capture policy is deliberately approved.

### Configure Pi

#### Interactive setup (recommended)

Start Pi, then run its package command:

```text
/langfuse-setup
```

Enter the Langfuse public key (`pk-lf-...`), secret key (`sk-lf-...`), and
external Langfuse URL. The package persists them in
`~/.pi/agent/pi-langfuse/config.json`; in the sandbox, `~/.pi` is on the
`pi-auth` named volume. When the package writes the file it creates a `0700`
directory and a `0600` file where POSIX permissions are available. `oh destroy`
removes named volumes, including `pi-auth`, so configure again after destroying
the sandbox.

#### Environment-only setup

For a non-interactive shell, export credentials before starting Pi:

```bash
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY='pk-lf-...'
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY='sk-lf-...'
export LANGFUSE_BASE_URL='https://cloud.langfuse.com'
export LANGFUSE_PRIVACY_PRESET='metadata-only'
pi
```

`LANGFUSE_HOST` is supported as a fallback name. For an environment-only
configuration, `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` wins over `LANGFUSE_HOST`.

`langfuse.baseUrl` and `langfuse.privacyPreset` in `agro.json` record the intended
values in one tracked place, but the harness does **not** project them into the
container — Pi reads them from its own process environment, so export them in the
shell that launches Pi (see the block above):

```json
{
  "langfuse": {
    "baseUrl": "http://langfuse-web:3000",
    "privacyPreset": "metadata-only"
  }
}
```

The two credentials stay secrets:
keep `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` in the root dotenv (`oh
secret set`) or in the saved `~/.pi/agent/pi-langfuse/config.json`, and export
them in the shell that launches Pi if you use the environment-only path.

### Pi configuration and privacy precedence

A valid saved `~/.pi/agent/pi-langfuse/config.json` (one with both keys) supplies
credentials and host before environment configuration. Environment privacy
settings still apply: `LANGFUSE_PRIVACY_PRESET` and the individual capture flags
override saved privacy settings. If there is no complete saved config,
environment credentials are used; then `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` takes precedence over
`LANGFUSE_HOST`.

The upstream default is `full-debug`, which captures prompts, outputs, tool I/O,
the system prompt, and cwd. Prefer a narrower preset unless that detail is
explicitly approved:

| Preset | Captures |
| --- | --- |
| `metadata-only` | metadata only; no inputs, outputs, tool I/O, system prompt, or cwd |
| `prompts-only` | inputs/prompts only; no outputs, tool I/O, system prompt, or cwd |
| `conversations` | inputs and assistant outputs; no tool I/O, system prompt, or cwd |
| `full-debug` (default) | inputs, outputs, tool I/O, system prompt, and cwd |

Fine-grained environment flags override a preset:

```bash
export LANGFUSE_CAPTURE_INPUTS=true
export LANGFUSE_CAPTURE_OUTPUTS=true
export LANGFUSE_CAPTURE_TOOL_IO=false
export LANGFUSE_CAPTURE_SYSTEM_PROMPT=false
export LANGFUSE_CAPTURE_CWD=false
```

The package redacts common secrets and local paths before upload, but redaction
is defense in depth, not permission to upload sensitive prompts, tool results,
or source context. Keep keys out of version control, use the least capture that
meets the need, and treat the Langfuse deployment as an external data boundary.

### Choose the URL from where Pi runs

| Pi location | Langfuse location | URL to configure | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Host shell | Langfuse on the same host | `http://localhost:3000` | Normal host-loopback case. |
| Sandbox | Langfuse on the Docker host | `http://host.docker.internal:3000` | The sandbox already maps `host.docker.internal` to Docker's host gateway. `localhost` inside the sandbox is the sandbox itself. |
| Sandbox | Another Compose service | that service's hostname, for example `http://langfuse-web:3000` | Works only after both services are explicitly attached to a shared Docker network. It is not automatic. |
| Sandbox or host | Cloud or remote self-hosted Langfuse | its HTTPS public URL | Verify DNS, TLS, routing, and firewall access from the process running Pi. |

### Verify Pi with a real prompt

1. Confirm Pi loaded the optional package:
   ```bash
   pi list
   ```
2. In Pi, run `/langfuse-status`. It shows the selected source, host, masked
   public key, effective capture policy, config path, and last runtime error.
3. Run `/langfuse-test`. It performs a timeout-bounded authenticated request and
   sends a small test trace.
4. Send a normal Pi prompt, then inspect the resulting trace in Langfuse. A
   real prompt is the end-to-end check for the session trace, generations, and
   any tool observations.

### Troubleshoot Pi

| Symptom | Check and fix |
| --- | --- |
| Missing keys or no configuration | Run `/langfuse-setup`, or export both `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` before starting Pi. |
| Old key or host still wins | A complete saved config takes precedence for credentials and host. Use `/langfuse-status` to see its source, then rerun `/langfuse-setup` to replace stale saved values. |
| Wrong URL | With environment-only setup, use `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL`; it wins over `LANGFUSE_HOST`. A saved host still wins over either, so update or remove the stale saved config deliberately. |
| Connection refused or timeout | Check the location table: sandbox `localhost` is not the Docker host; use `host.docker.internal` for the host, or explicitly share a Compose network for a service hostname. |
| `DOMException [AbortError]` during shutdown | Rerun `bash .pi/install/install-langfuse.sh` so the reviewed local patch is applied. The package's own bounded deadline is best-effort and may leave telemetry incomplete; unexpected shutdown errors remain visible. |
| TLS or DNS error | Use the externally reachable HTTPS URL, verify the hostname resolves from the Pi process, and provide a certificate chain trusted by that process. |
| Test works but no useful trace | Send a real Pi prompt after `/langfuse-test`, then use `/langfuse-status` and Pi output for the last runtime error and effective capture policy. |
| Usage or cost is absent | These fields are conditional on provider events. Some providers do not expose them; inspect raw observations and do not treat their absence as a tracing failure. |

For package installation scope, pins, and trust behavior, see the upstream
[Pi packages documentation](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/packages.md).
The repository helper intentionally uses user scope so opting into observability
does not modify the tracked project package list.

## Claude Code

The official, supported Claude Code path is Langfuse's marketplace plugin, not
native Claude OpenTelemetry environment variables. The plugin repository is
[Langfuse/Claude-Observability-Plugin](https://github.com/langfuse/Claude-Observability-Plugin),
observed at commit
[`9ad0076a7a24e8673ac6e7ac6f7b658b18826bb6`](https://github.com/langfuse/Claude-Observability-Plugin/commit/9ad0076a7a24e8673ac6e7ac6f7b658b18826bb6)
(version 1.0.0). Review plugin source before installing it: marketplace plugins
can execute code and add hooks to Claude Code.

### Install and configure

From a shell that runs Claude Code, install the marketplace and plugin exactly
as follows:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add langfuse/Claude-Observability-Plugin
claude plugin install langfuse-observability@langfuse-observability
```

Restart Claude Code. Then, at the **Claude prompt** (not the shell), run:

```text
/plugin configure langfuse-observability@langfuse-observability
```

Enter the two required fields in the plugin configuration:

- `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`

`LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` is optional and defaults to the US region
(`https://us.cloud.langfuse.com`); use `https://cloud.langfuse.com` for EU or
your self-hosted URL. Other optional fields are `LANGFUSE_USER_ID`,
`CC_LANGFUSE_DEBUG` (default `false`), `CC_LANGFUSE_MAX_CHARS` (default
`20000`), `CC_LANGFUSE_SKILL_TAGS` (default `true`), and
`CC_LANGFUSE_CAPTURE_SKILL_CONTENT` (default `false`). The plugin needs `uv`
(already installed in Open Harness), or its Python 3.10+ fallback with
`langfuse>=4.0,<5`. Do not add a separate `pip install` when `uv` is available.

The plugin installs and is enabled at **user scope**. Configuration is stored by
Claude's plugin configuration and OS-keychain mechanisms according to upstream.
Open Harness persists `~/.claude` in the `/home/sandbox` mount, but OS-keychain
availability and persistence are platform-dependent; verify the plugin remains
configured after a sandbox rebuild. You can enter the same Langfuse key pair in
Pi and Claude Code, but their saved configurations are independent. Do not put
Claude plugin keys in `.devcontainer/.env`, source files, shell history,
screenshots, or chat.

### Choose the Claude plugin base URL

Set `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` according to where the Claude Code process runs:

| Claude Code location | Langfuse location | `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host shell | Same host | `http://localhost:3000` |
| Sandbox | Docker host | `http://host.docker.internal:3000` |
| Sandbox | Local Langfuse Compose service on an explicitly shared Docker network | `http://langfuse-web:3000` |
| Host or sandbox | Cloud or remote self-hosted deployment | Its externally reachable HTTPS URL |

`localhost` from the sandbox is the sandbox itself. The host-gateway mapping
makes `host.docker.internal` the host route. The `langfuse-web` name works only
after explicit shared-network attachment; Open Harness does not modify Compose
or create that connection automatically. For a remote or Cloud endpoint, verify
DNS, TLS, routing, and firewall access from the process running Claude Code.

### Privacy and capture boundary

The plugin uses Claude Code Stop and SessionEnd hooks plus transcript files. It
captures user prompts, assistant text, tool invocations, tool inputs and
results, session and timing data, and token usage when present.
`CC_LANGFUSE_MAX_CHARS` defaults to 20,000 characters for relevant captured
text and results; it is not a universal field-size cap, and structured tool
inputs are not recursively truncated.

This is not Pi's `metadata-only` model: the plugin offers no general redaction,
no metadata-only mode, and no prompt-off control.
`CC_LANGFUSE_CAPTURE_SKILL_CONTENT` defaults to `false`, but the conversation
and tool data above are otherwise captured. The official integration page
loosely mentions reasoning; do **not** rely on that as a capture claim—the
examined plugin text extractor includes text blocks only and does not extract
Claude thinking blocks.

Treat every trace as data sent to the Langfuse deployment. Before a sensitive
session, disable the plugin at user scope and restart Claude Code:

```bash
claude plugin disable langfuse-observability@langfuse-observability --scope user
claude plugin list
```

Re-enable it when approved, then restart Claude Code:

```bash
claude plugin enable langfuse-observability@langfuse-observability --scope user
claude plugin list
```

To remove it instead:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall langfuse-observability
```

### Verify and troubleshoot

After configuration and restart, send a non-sensitive test prompt in Claude
Code and confirm that its trace appears in the selected Langfuse project. For
hook diagnostics, inspect `~/.claude/state/langfuse_hook.log` without exposing
credentials. Restart Claude Code after installation or disable/enable changes.

The plugin supports the Claude Code CLI and Claude Code GUI **Code** mode. It
does not instrument Claude Desktop Chat. This guide intentionally adds no MCP
server, custom launcher, adapter, native service, or native OTEL configuration.
