# Lifecycle commands (`agro`)

`agro` is the only front door to the sandbox lifecycle. This page is the single
source of truth for the verbs; every other document links here rather than
restating them.

Every `agro <verb>` is also available as `oh <verb>`. `oh` is the compatibility
alias: the same executable, invoked under its legacy name, for the window the
[AGRO compatibility contract](agro-compatibility.md) defines. The one verb whose
meaning depends on the name is `update` — see
[`agro update`](#upgrading-the-cli-agro-update) and
[`oh update`](#equipping-a-checkout-oh-update) below.

Every compose verb runs `.agro/scripts/docker-compose.sh`, which owns overlay
resolution, project naming, and env plumbing. `agro` is the surface; the script
is the mechanism.

A sandbox is a **registry entry** under `${OH_HOME:-~/.oh}/sandboxes/<name>/`.
`agro sandbox install docker` writes it, and every later verb finds it by name
from any directory — no project checkout required. Details:
[Configuration → the two `agro.json` files](configuration.md#the-two-agrojson-files).

Host prerequisites: **Docker** (with the Compose plugin), **Git**, and
**Node.js ≥ 20**. Node runs `agro` itself; `get-agro.sh` installs it for you
when it is missing. Everything else — pnpm, Python, the agent CLIs — lives inside the
sandbox.

## The verbs

| Verb | Runs |
|---|---|
| `agro sandbox install <runtime> [--name <name>] [--repo <dir>] [--yes] [--image[=<ref>]] [--no-build]` | write the registry entry, then `docker-compose.sh up -d` inside it |
| `agro sandbox list [--json]` | every registry entry: name, runtime, status, repo |
| `agro shell [name]` | an interactive `zsh` in the sandbox container |
| `agro stop [name]` | `docker-compose.sh stop` — containers down, volumes kept |
| `agro restart [name]` | `docker-compose.sh restart` |
| `agro logs [name]` | `docker-compose.sh logs -f` |
| `agro ps [name]` | `docker-compose.sh ps` |
| `agro destroy [name] [--yes]` | `docker-compose.sh down -v`, then remove the registry entry — see below |
| `agro compose config` | `docker-compose.sh config` — the resolved compose file |
| `agro update [--dry-run]` | upgrade the installed `agro` executable through the mechanism that installed it — see below |
| `oh update [--from <dir> \| --from-remote [--ref <ref>]] [--dry-run] [--force]` | equip an empty checkout with `.agro/` + `crons/`, and upgrade an equipped one (compatibility window) |
| `agro config show [--sandbox <name>]` · `agro config set <field> <value> [--sandbox <name>]` | read and write `agro.json` |
| `agro config repo` · `agro config <integration>` | GitHub-remote and integration wizards |
| `agro secret set <KEY> [--sandbox <name>]` · `agro secret list [--sandbox <name>]` | read and write the gitignored `.env` |
| `agro gateway <pi\|hermes>` · `agro gateway status` | `.agro/scripts/gateway.sh` |
| `agro harness` · `agro tool` | install and inspect harnesses and tooling |
| `agro cloud` | manage OpenHarness Cloud nodes |
| `agro --help` · `agro --version` | usage and version |

`agro <verb> -- <args>` forwards extra arguments to `docker compose`, e.g.
`agro logs -- --tail 50`.

## Creating a sandbox

`agro sandbox install docker` is the one command that creates a sandbox. It runs
from **any** directory:

```bash
agro sandbox install docker      # wizard: name, timezone, git identity, SSH, Docker socket
agro shell <name>                # attach as the sandbox user
```

- The entry lands in `${OH_HOME:-~/.oh}/sandboxes/<name>/`, holding its own
  `agro.json`, its `.env`, and the compose files plus the wrapper script the CLI
  re-materialises on every lifecycle call. Edit `agro.json`; the rest is generated.
- The default name is `oh-sbx-<n>`, the lowest unused number. `--yes` prompts
  zero times and keeps every default.
- Without `--repo` the sandbox runs the prebuilt image and the image's
  `/opt/oh-seed` seeds the workspace volume. With `--repo <dir>` that checkout
  is bind-mounted at `/home/sandbox/harness` and can be built locally. Recipes:
  [`agro sandbox install docker`](deployment-prebuilt-image.md).
- `docker` is the only provisionable runtime today. `agro sandbox install
  microsandbox` refuses and points at
  [the runtime RFC](rfcs/rfc-runtime-support.md); inside a sandbox,
  `agro tool install microsandbox` installs the `msb` binary.

`agro sandbox` with no subcommand prints help and exits non-zero.

## How a verb finds your sandbox

`agro shell|stop|restart|logs|ps|destroy [name]` resolve in this order:

1. the `name` you passed;
2. the single registered entry, when exactly one exists;
3. the entry whose `repo` contains the current directory;
4. otherwise an error listing every registered name.

`agro sandbox list` prints that list, with the container status of each.

## Upgrading the CLI: `agro update`

`agro update` upgrades exactly one thing: the `agro` executable that is running.
It writes no project file — no `.agro/`, no `agro.json`, no `.env` — and it never
asks for `sudo`. The upgrade follows whichever mechanism installed the
executable:

| Installation | Detected as | What `agro update` does |
|---|---|---|
| `npm install -g @mifune/agro` | realpath under `node_modules/@mifune/agro/` | reads the registry version with `npm view`, then runs `npm install -g --prefix <owning prefix> @mifune/agro@<version>` |
| `get-agro.sh` | a plain file | downloads `AGRO_JS_URL` (falls back to `OH_JS_URL`; default `https://github.com/mifunedev/openharness/releases/latest/download/agro.js`) into the same directory, checks its shebang and `--version`, renames it over the executable, and keeps `<path>.prev` until the new file verifies |

It refuses, and prints the supported procedure, when the executable is shipped
by the sandbox image (`/opt/oh`), is a source checkout's `dist/`, belongs to the
legacy `@mifune/openharness` package, cannot be resolved, sits in a read-only
directory, is shadowed by another `agro` earlier on PATH, or does not report the
running version. Downgrades are refused. When the installed version is already
current it changes nothing. `--dry-run` reports the installation kind, target,
and versions without changing anything.

`agro update` rejects the payload flags `--from`, `--from-remote`, `--ref`, and
`--force` and points at `oh update`.

## Equipping a checkout: `oh update`

During the compatibility window, `oh update` is the command that vendors the
`.agro/` control plane and `crons/` into the current directory. An empty directory
is equipped from scratch; an equipped one is upgraded. Payload precedence:
`--from <dir>`, then `--from-remote [--ref <ref>]`, then the CLI's own bundled
payload, then a remote fetch announced on one line. `--dry-run` previews the
changes; `--force` overrides the up-to-date and downgrade gate.

It writes **nothing else** — no `agro.json`, no `.env`, no `AGENTS.md`, no
`.gitignore` line, no `.devcontainer/`, no provider configuration. Those files
are yours. It never prompts. It does not upgrade the CLI itself; that is
`agro update`.

## Where you are standing when you type `agro`

`agro` runs on the host **and** inside the sandbox, and it resolves a different
execution target for each. On the host it drives the container through Docker
Compose. Inside the sandbox it runs commands directly, because the sandbox *is*
the environment those commands target.

Detection is automatic: `agro` treats itself as in-sandbox when `/.dockerenv`
exists **and** `SANDBOX_NAME` is set. Override it with
`OH_EXECUTION_TARGET=local` or `OH_EXECUTION_TARGET=docker-compose`.

| Verb | On the host | Inside the sandbox |
|---|---|---|
| `agro harness install` · `agro tool install` | installs into the running container over Docker Compose | installs live, in place |
| `agro harness list/status` · `agro tool list/status` | reports `?` when the container is not reachable | reports the real state of this environment |
| `agro sandbox install` | provisions the sandbox | refuses with a host-only error |
| `agro shell` | `docker exec` into the container | opens a local `zsh` |

`agro sandbox install` changes the sandbox's own Docker configuration, so it stays
host-only rather than failing halfway.

`agro harness install <id>` and `agro tool install <id>` are the only way a harness
or a tool enters the sandbox. Nothing installs at boot, so a fresh sandbox has
no `herdr` until you run `agro tool install herdr`. Each install lands in
`~/.local` in the persistent home volume; `agro destroy` removes it. See
[Harnesses Overview](harnesses/overview.md#installing-a-harness).

## `agro destroy` and its confirmation policy

`down -v` wipes the sandbox home volume, and that volume holds provider
authentication. `agro destroy` is therefore the only lifecycle verb that asks
before it runs. It names the volumes it is about to delete — read from
`.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`, not hardcoded — then requires you to type
the sandbox name. A blank line, a wrong name, or anything else aborts with a
non-zero exit and removes nothing.

Once `down -v` succeeds the registry entry under
`${OH_HOME:-~/.oh}/sandboxes/<name>/` is removed too, so the name becomes free
again.

When `storage.homePath` points the home mount at a host path, `down -v` cannot
delete it. `agro destroy` says so and leaves the directory in place; remove it
yourself if you want it gone.

Non-interactive use is gated on an explicit flag. When stdin is not a terminal
and `--yes` is absent, `agro destroy` refuses outright rather than assume consent.

## `agro compose config`, not `agro config`

`agro config` already means *"read, write, or configure configuration"*
(`agro config show`, `agro config set`, `agro config <integration>`), so the
resolved-compose printer lives under its own namespace: `agro compose config`.
That leaves room for further `agro compose <passthrough>` verbs without ever
colliding with the config and integration verbs.

## VS Code "Reopen in Container" applies no overlays

Attaching VS Code to a container that `agro sandbox install docker` already
started is safe and is the recommended editor path — see
[Connecting to the sandbox](connecting.md).

**Provisioning** from VS Code is different. *Dev Containers: Reopen in
Container* reads `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, whose `dockerComposeFile`
lists `docker-compose.yml` and nothing else. It never runs
`.agro/scripts/docker-compose.sh`, so **no overlay applies on that path**:

- `access.ssh` → no `docker-compose.ssh.yml`, so no sshd and no published SSH port
- `access.dockerSocket` → no `docker-compose.docker-sock.yml`, so no host Docker socket
- `composeOverrides[]` → every extra overlay path is ignored

Secrets still reach that container: compose auto-loads the `.devcontainer/.env`
beside the compose file, and that file is a symlink to the root `.env`.
Non-secret `agro.json` settings only reach compose when `oh` renders them, so on
this path each variable falls back to its default in
`.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`.

:::danger `storage.homePath` is ignored on this path
`OH_HOME_MOUNT` is one of those rendered-only variables, so *Reopen in
Container* falls back to the Docker-managed `<name>_workspace` volume even when
`storage.homePath` points the sandbox home at a host directory. That is a
**second, separate home**: agent logins made through `agro sandbox install docker` are not there,
and the two diverge silently from then on.

If you set `storage.homePath`, always provision with `agro sandbox install
docker` and attach.
:::

If you need any overlay, provision with `agro sandbox install docker` and then use
*Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container* instead of *Reopen in Container*.
