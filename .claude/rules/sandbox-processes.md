# In-Sandbox Process Lifecycle

## Source of Truth

Every long-running process inside a sandbox — dev servers, tunnels, AI
agents, background workers, heartbeats — MUST run inside a named tmux
session. This is the single mechanism for inspection, attach/detach,
restart, and log capture across all internal apps.

`tmux` is preinstalled in the sandbox image; a default `.tmux.conf` is
baked in (see commit `b30cef9`).

## Session Naming

Format: `<category>-<identifier>` (kebab-case inside each segment).

| Category | Example | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `app-` | `app-docs`, `app-api` | User dev servers |
| `expose-public-` | `expose-public-3000` | Cloudflare quick tunnels (auto-created) |
| `agent-` | `agent-claude`, `agent-pi` | AI agent processes |
| `heartbeat-` | `heartbeat-daily-sync` | Scheduled heartbeat tasks |

Reserved prefix: `system-`. Do not use for user apps.

## Grouping Related Apps Into One Session

When several processes belong to the same project (e.g. frontend + API +
worker for a single app), put them in **one session** as stacked panes
rather than three sibling sessions. This keeps related logs visible at a
glance, lets you attach once to see the whole stack, and makes
`tmux ls` reflect logical groups, not process count.

Layout convention: **horizontal separators, panes stacked top-to-bottom**
(each app's log occupies a full-width row). The pane below the one above
is created with `tmux split-window` (default orientation) or `-v`.

```bash
# Launch the "docs-site" group: one session, three stacked panes.
tmux new-session  -d  -s app-docs-site 'pnpm --filter web dev        2>&1 | tee /tmp/app-docs-site.web.log'
tmux split-window -t app-docs-site     'pnpm --filter api dev        2>&1 | tee /tmp/app-docs-site.api.log'
tmux split-window -t app-docs-site     'pnpm --filter worker start   2>&1 | tee /tmp/app-docs-site.worker.log'
tmux select-layout -t app-docs-site even-vertical    # equal row heights
```

Per-pane log files follow `/tmp/<session>.<pane-label>.log` so each
process has its own file without losing the grouping.

When in doubt (not clearly "related"), err on the side of **separate
sessions** — it's always safe to split later; merging independent
sessions into one is not.

## Why

- `oh ports` cross-references listening sockets to tmux sessions so every
  listener can be traced back to the command that owns it.
- Terminal-bound processes survive disconnects; reattach with
  `tmux attach -t <name>`.
- Restart is deterministic: `tmux kill-session -t <name>` then relaunch
  with the same command.
- No need for `nohup`, `systemd-user`, or ad-hoc backgrounding inside the
  sandbox — tmux is the single convention.

## Starting a Session

Inside the sandbox:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s app-docs 'pnpm --filter @openharness/docs dev 2>&1 | tee /tmp/app-docs.log'
```

The `tee` to `/tmp/<session>.log` is the convention — `oh` tooling may
read those paths in the future.

From the host:

```bash
oh run oh-local 'tmux new-session -d -s app-docs "pnpm ... 2>&1 | tee /tmp/app-docs.log"'
```

## Anti-patterns

- **Foregrounded inside another session** — starting a dev server in the
  foreground of an `agent-*` pane makes logs shared, restart awkward.
- **`nohup cmd &`** — orphans the process, lost on container restart,
  invisible to `oh ports` / tmux listing.
- **Running as root** — breaks `/proc/<pid>/fd/*` resolution for the
  sandbox user, so `oh ports` can't surface the PROCESS column.
- **Unnamed sessions** (`tmux` with no `-s`) — shows as `0`, `1`, `2` in
  `tmux ls`; `oh ports` can't match them back to an app.

## Interaction With `oh expose`

`oh expose <name> <port>` routes traffic to a listening port. The *port*
is what the gateway cares about; the *process* behind that port should
still be managed via tmux. A typical flow:

```bash
# Start the app in tmux (inside sandbox):
tmux new-session -d -s app-docs 'pnpm dev -p 8080'

# Route to it via Caddy (from host):
oh expose docs 8080
# → https://docs.oh-local.localhost:8443
```
