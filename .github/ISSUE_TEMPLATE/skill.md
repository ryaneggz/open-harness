## Skill Structure

> Skills are modular instruction packages — NOT agents, NOT slash commands. They live at `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` and follow progressive disclosure: metadata is always loaded, SKILL.md loads when triggered, resources load on demand.

```
<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: frontmatter + instructions
├── scripts/              # Optional: executable code for deterministic tasks
├── references/           # Optional: docs loaded contextually
└── assets/               # Optional: output-ready files (NOT loaded in context)
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: <skill-name>
description: |
  Triggering info goes HERE in the frontmatter, not in the body.
  Describe when and why Claude should apply this skill.
